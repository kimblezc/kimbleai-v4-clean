- Basic chat functionality
- User authentication (Zach/Rebecca)
- File upload endpoint
- Knowledge base structure

### NEEDS VERIFICATION:
- Vector similarity search depth
- Cross-conversation memory persistence
- File content indexing speed
- Project/tag database storage

## IDENTIFIED GAPS

### CRITICAL MISSING FEATURES:

1. **Google Drive Integration**
   - Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - Needs: OAuth2 setup, Drive API integration
   - Impact: Cannot access Google Drive documents

2. **Gmail Integration**
   - Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - Needs: Gmail API, OAuth2, message parsing
   - Impact: Cannot search email history

3. **Google OAuth Flow**
   - Status: PLACEHOLDER ONLY
   - Needs: Google Cloud Console setup
   - Impact: No actual Google service access

4. **PDF Text Extraction**
   - Status: UPLOAD ONLY
   - Needs: PDF parsing library
   - Impact: PDFs stored but content not extracted

### FUNCTIONAL GAPS:

5. **Conversation Export**
   - Missing: Export to PDF/MD/TXT
   - Impact: No backup/sharing capability

6. **Advanced Search UI**
   - Missing: Filter by date/project/tags
   - Impact: Hard to find specific conversations

7. **Bulk Operations**
   - Missing: Multi-file upload
   - Missing: Bulk delete conversations
   - Impact: Inefficient for large-scale use

8. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Status: Desktop-optimized only
   - Impact: Poor mobile experience

### INFRASTRUCTURE GAPS:

9. **Monitoring/Analytics**
   - Missing: Usage statistics
   - Missing: Error tracking
   - Impact: No visibility into system health

10. **Backup System**
    - Missing: Automated backups
    - Impact: Risk of data loss

## IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### Priority 1 - Google Integration:
1. Create Google Cloud Project
2. Enable Drive and Gmail APIs
3. Set up OAuth 2.0 credentials
4. Implement OAuth flow in Next.js
5. Add Drive search endpoint
6. Add Gmail search endpoint

### Priority 2 - Core Functionality:
1. Add PDF text extraction (pdf-parse library)
2. Implement conversation export
3. Add search filters UI
4. Test vector search accuracy

### Priority 3 - User Experience:
1. Add loading states for all operations
2. Implement error recovery
3. Add help documentation
4. Create onboarding flow

## COST OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

- Current: ~$25/month
- Optimization: Batch embeddings to reduce API calls
- Consider: Caching frequent queries
- Monitor: OpenAI token usage

## SECURITY CHECKLIST

- [x] User data isolation
- [x] API key protection
- [ ] Rate limiting on endpoints
- [ ] Input sanitization for files
- [ ] CORS configuration
- [ ] Session management

## NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDATION

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Set up Google Cloud Console for OAuth
2. **TODAY**: Test all existing features thoroughly
3. **THIS WEEK**: Implement Google Drive integration
4. **NEXT WEEK**: Add Gmail integration
5. **ONGOING**: Monitor usage and optimize
