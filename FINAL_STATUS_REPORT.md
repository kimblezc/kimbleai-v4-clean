## üîÑ WHAT WAS ACTIVELY WORKED ON (DETAIL & PROCESS)

### Dark Theme Conversion (Completed)

**Process:**
1. **Research Phase (5 min):**
   - Read `app/globals.css` to understand main site colors

   - Found dark theme patterns

2. **Header Transformation (10 min):**
   - Changed background to `bg-gray-900`
   - Updated title to white
   - Added dark status badges with colored backgrounds
   - Redesigned navigation with blue active state

3. **Findings View Transformation (30 min):**
   - Converted all light colors to dark equivalents
   - Added semi-transparent colored overlays
   - Implemented glowing shadows
   - Updated text colors for proper contrast
   - Enhanced file cards with dark theme
   - Updated badges and borders

4. **Priority Tasks Addition (20 min):**
   - Designed new summary layout
   - Created green-themed completed task cards

**Total Time:** ~80 minutes

---

### File Modification Capability (Completed Earlier)

3. Archie can now attempt file modifications when enabled
4. Maintains safety: backups, rollback, risk assessment

**Files:** `lib/autonomous-agent.ts`

---

### Middleware Fix (Completed Earlier)

**Process:**
1. Identified `/api/agent` returning 401
2. Added `/api/agent` to PUBLIC_PATHS
3. Deployed fix
4. Verified manual trigger works

**Files:** `middleware.ts`

---

## ‚è∞ WHAT HASN'T BEEN DONE YET (WILL WORK ON)

### 1. Other View Themes (Tasks, Logs, Reports)
**Why Not Done:** Focused on Summary and Findings first (most important)

**What Needs Updating:**
- Tasks view still has light theme elements
- Logs view still has light backgrounds
- Reports view needs dark theme

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes per view

**Priority:** MEDIUM (Summary and Findings are primary views)

---

### 2. Loading State Dark Theme
**Why Not Done:** Minor visual element

**What Needs Updating:**
- Loading spinner background
- "Loading..." text color

**Estimated Time:** 5 minutes

**Priority:** LOW

---

### 3. Summary View Statistics
**Why Not Done:** Removed old layout, may add back later

**What Was Removed:**
- Statistics cards (Tasks, Findings, Logs counts)
- "What Archie is Doing Right Now" widget
- Latest Report section

**What Could Be Added Back:**
- Quick stats overview in dark theme
- Current activity indicator
- Compact report summary

**Estimated Time:** 45 minutes

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

### 4. Mobile Responsiveness Optimization
**Why Not Done:** Desktop-first approach

**What Needs Work:**
- Priority task cards on mobile
- Findings implementation plans on small screens
- Navigation overflow handling

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

**Priority:** MEDIUM (site has mobile support, needs optimization)

---

### 5. Summary View Polish
**Why Not Done:** Old summary removed, new one is functional but basic

**What Could Be Enhanced:**
- Add back report section (dark themed)
- Add quick stats overview
- Show recent activity widget
- Add system health indicator

**Estimated Time:** 60 minutes

**Priority:** MEDIUM
