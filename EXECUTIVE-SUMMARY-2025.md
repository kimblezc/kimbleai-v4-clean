# Executive Summary: What to Build Next

**Date:** January 10, 2025
**Context:** Analysis of latest 2025 AI tech for KimbleAI

## üéØ Bottom Line

**BUILD WRITE AGENTS FIRST. Everything else is secondary.**

---

## ‚úÖ What to Do (Prioritized)

### **1. Write Agents** (2 weeks) ‚≠ê DO THIS NOW
- Gmail Send Agent - send/reply to emails
- Drive Create Agent - create/edit files
- Calendar Event Agent - schedule meetings

**Why:** This is your #1 goal. Can't achieve anything without write capabilities.

### **2. Task Decomposition** (2 weeks) ‚≠ê DO THIS NEXT
- Break complex requests into steps
- "Send Q4 budget" ‚Üí find file ‚Üí update ‚Üí email ‚Üí done
- Handle dependencies and errors

**Why:** Users want complex automation, not just single actions.

### **3. Agent Learning** (3 weeks) üìà HIGH VALUE
- ReasoningBank pattern (Google Research, Oct 2025)
- Agents learn from successes AND failures
- Get better over time

**Why:** Your agents currently don't improve. This makes them smarter with use.

### **4. Async Task Queue** (1 week) üí° NICE TO HAVE
- Long operations run in background
- User gets progress updates
- No more 5-minute loading spinners

**Why:** Better UX, but not critical to core functionality.

### **5. MCP Standardization** (2 weeks) üîß OPTIONAL
- Model Context Protocol for tool integration
- Community-maintained servers for Gmail/Drive/Calendar
- Standard protocol vs custom wrappers

**Why:** Better architecture long-term, but not urgent.

---

## ‚ùå What to Ignore

1. **Claude Desktop Plugins** - Wrong platform (you're building web app)
2. **n8n/Zapier** - Wrong approach (you need custom control)
3. **LangChain/Python tools** - Wrong stack (you use TypeScript)
4. **Commercial competitors** - Study for ideas, don't use
5. **Google Workspace Flows** - Still alpha, you have better architecture

---

## üìä Critical Gaps in Your System

1. ‚ùå **No write capabilities** - Can't send emails, create files, schedule events
2. ‚ùå **No agent learning** - Each conversation starts fresh, no improvement
3. ‚ùå **No multi-step planning** - Can't handle "find ‚Üí update ‚Üí send" chains
4. ‚ùå **No error recovery** - If fails, user retries manually
5. ‚ùå **No async execution** - Long tasks block user

**Gap #1 is URGENT. Rest are nice-to-have.**

---

## üí° Key Technologies from 2025

### **ReasoningBank** (Google Cloud AI, Oct 2025) ‚úÖ USEFUL
- Framework for agent learning
- Distills reasoning strategies from successes/failures
- Agents improve over time
- **Verdict:** Adopt after write agents work

### **Claude Agent SDK** ‚ö†Ô∏è INTERESTING BUT NOT URGENT
- Gives Claude a "computer environment"
- Built-in memory and context management
- Autonomous agent patterns
- **Verdict:** Study patterns, but OpenAI function calling works fine

### **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** ‚úÖ USEFUL
- Standard protocol for tool integration
- MCP servers exist for Gmail/Drive/Calendar
- Community-maintained
- **Verdict:** Adopt after write agents work

### **Mem0, A-MEM, Memory Frameworks** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY HAVE
- You already have unlimited storage (95% Drive)
- Missing: structured memory organization, preference learning
- **Verdict:** Enhance existing memory system later

---

## üìÖ 10-Week Roadmap

**Weeks 1-2:** Write Agents (Gmail/Drive/Calendar)
**Weeks 3-4:** Task Decomposition (multi-step planning)
**Weeks 5-7:** Agent Learning (ReasoningBank pattern)
**Weeks 8-9:** Async Task Queue (background jobs)
**Week 10:** Cost Optimization (50-70% reduction)

---

## üéØ Success Criteria (Week 2)

From your iPhone, you can:
‚úÖ "Send Rebecca the Q4 budget spreadsheet"
‚úÖ "Create a meeting notes doc for today's call"
‚úÖ "Schedule client meeting for next Tuesday at 2pm"

**If you can do those 3 things, you've achieved your core goal.**

Everything else is enhancement.

---

## üöÄ Next Immediate Action

**Today:** Start building `app/api/agents/gmail/send/route.ts`

**Endpoint:**
```typescript
POST /api/agents/gmail/send
{
  to: "client@example.com",
  subject: "Q4 Budget",
  body: "...",
  attachments: ["drive_file_id_123"]
}
```

**Test:** "Send test email to yourself with Drive file attached"

**Timeline:** Should work by end of Day 3

---

## üí¨ What the Research Says

**What's HOT in 2025:**
- Agent learning/memory (ReasoningBank, Mem0, A-MEM)
- Multi-agent orchestration (AutoGen, CrewAI patterns)
- MCP standardization (Anthropic + Google support)
- Async/agentic workflows
- Cost optimization (right model for right task)

**What's NOT Relevant for You:**
- Visual workflow tools (wrong approach)
- Desktop-only solutions (wrong platform)
- Python frameworks (wrong stack)
- Commercial platforms (you're building your own)

**What You're Already Doing Right:**
- Browser-based (works everywhere)
- Multi-user architecture
- Unlimited storage (95% Drive)
- RAG + semantic search
- Cost monitoring

---

## üéØ The Big Picture

You're building a **personal Google Workspace AI assistant** that:
- Works on any device (iPhone, Android, PC, Mac)
- Actually DOES things (not just searches)
- Shared by Zach + Rebecca
- Learns and improves over time
- Costs less than commercial alternatives

**Current Status:** 70% complete
- ‚úÖ Read-only access (Gmail, Drive, Calendar)
- ‚úÖ RAG + semantic search
- ‚úÖ Multi-user
- ‚úÖ Cost monitoring
- ‚ùå Write capabilities ‚Üê **THIS IS THE GAP**

**After write agents:** 95% complete
**After task planning:** 98% complete
**After agent learning:** 100% complete (production-ready)

---

## üí∞ Cost vs Value Analysis

### Commercial Alternatives:
- Gemini Advanced: $20/user/month = $40/month (read-only)
- Zenphi: $15-30/user/month = $30-60/month
- Claude Pro + MCP: $20/user/month = $40/month

**Your system:**
- Infrastructure: $60-120/month
- API costs: ~$20-40/month
- Total: $80-160/month
- **BUT:** Full control, unlimited storage, custom features

**Value add from new features:**
- Write agents: +$100/month value (2hrs/week saved @ $50/hr)
- Task automation: +$200/month value (4hrs/week saved)
- Agent learning: +$100/month value (smarter over time)
- **Total value:** $400/month for $100-160/month cost

**ROI:** 2.5-4x return on investment

---

## üé¨ Final Word

**The latest 2025 AI tech is exciting:**
- ReasoningBank (agents learn)
- MCP (standardization)
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Advanced memory frameworks

**But you don't need any of it YET.**

**What you need RIGHT NOW:**
1. Send an email
2. Create a file
3. Schedule a meeting

**Everything else can wait.**

Build the core. Ship it. Use it. Then enhance it.

**Start with Gmail Send Agent. Today.**
