## CURRENT STATUS

### What's Working:
- ✅ Basic chat interface with OpenAI
- ✅ Messages display and input
- ✅ Deployed to Vercel
- ✅ API responds without hallucinations

### What's NOT Working:
- ❌ Sidebar not visible (code exists but not rendering)
- ❌ Project/tag inputs not visible (code exists but not rendering)
- ❌ Conversation history not showing
- ❌ Too many conflicting deployment scripts
- ❌ Overly complex for 2-person use case

```

## REAL REQUIREMENTS (2 PEOPLE)

1. **Chat with memory** - Remember past conversations
2. **Simple organization** - Projects and tags
3. **Works on all devices** - PC, Mac, Android, iPhone
4. **Local file access** - Read/write files
5. **Google integration** - Drive, Gmail
6. **Low cost** - Under $25/month

## WHAT ACTUALLY NEEDS FIXING

### 1. UI Not Rendering
The page.tsx has all the code but the UI elements aren't showing. Likely issues:
- Tailwind classes not compiling
- React state not updating
- CSS conflicts

### 2. Too Much Complexity
For 2 people we DON'T need:
- Multiple agent systems
- Complex message reference systems
- Dozens of deployment scripts
- Vector databases
- Elaborate logging systems

### 3. Simple Supabase Setup
Just need basic tables:
```sql
-- Users (2 people)
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  email TEXT
);

-- Conversations
CREATE TABLE conversations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  title TEXT,
  project TEXT,
  tags TEXT[],
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Messages
CREATE TABLE messages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  conversation_id UUID REFERENCES conversations(id),
  role TEXT,
  content TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## SENSIBLE ZAPIER USES (NOT OVERKILL)

1. **Daily Summary** - Email recap of conversations
2. **Error Alerts** - If the app breaks
3. **Backup** - Weekly export to Google Drive
4. **Cost Monitor** - Alert if OpenAI bill exceeds $20

That's it. Not 10 different agent systems.

## SINGLE DEPLOYMENT SCRIPT NEEDED

Replace all 47 scripts with ONE:

```powershell
# deploy.ps1
npm run build
git add -A
git commit -m "Update"
git push
Write-Host "Deployed to Vercel"
```

## IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED

1. **Make UI visible** - Debug why Tailwind isn't working
2. **Remove complexity** - Delete unnecessary agent systems
3. **Test locally** - Ensure features work before deploying
4. **Clean up** - Delete 46 deployment scripts

## FOR NEXT SESSION

When continuing, focus on:
1. Fix the UI rendering issue
2. Keep it simple for 2 people
3. Use Supabase (already set up)
4. One deployment script
5. Basic Zapier for monitoring only

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

Currently configured:
- OPENAI_API_KEY (working)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL (set but not used)
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (set but not used)

## PROBLEMS TO AVOID

- Don't add more complexity
- Don't create more deployment scripts
- Don't add vector databases for 2 people
- Don't overcomplicate with agents
- Check that UI actually renders before deploying

## CONTINUITY INSTRUCTION

Next session should:
1. Run `npm run dev` locally
2. Open http://localhost:3000
3. Check DevTools console for errors
4. Fix the actual UI rendering issue
5. Delete unnecessary complexity
6. Test with real use case: "Remember that Zach likes blue"

The project has become overcomplicated. It needs simplification, not more features.
