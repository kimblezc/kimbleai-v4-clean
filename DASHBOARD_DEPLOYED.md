## Status: LIVE IN PRODUCTION

The new 4-column bordered dashboard is **fully deployed** and working on kimbleai.com!

### What Was Deployed

#### New Dashboard Features
- **4-Column Grid Layout** with colored borders:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green Border: **COMPLETED** tasks (with details and results)
  - ðŸ”µ Blue Border: **IN PROGRESS** tasks (with progress bars and percentages)
  - ðŸŸ  Orange Border: **PENDING** tasks (with explanations)
  - ðŸŸ£ Purple Border: **SUGGESTIONS** (from Archie based on PROJECT_GOALS.md)

- **Enhanced UX**:
  - Progress bars showing task completion percentage
  - Detailed descriptions of why tasks are pending
  - Integration with PROJECT_GOALS.md priorities
  - Real-time updates every 30 seconds

- **Consolidation**:
  - `/accomplishments` now redirects to `/agent`
  - All task tracking in one place

### Verification Completed

âœ… **Deployment ID**: `kimbleai-v4-clean-f2bhklg3n-kimblezcs-projects.vercel.app`
âœ… **Domains Assigned**: www.kimbleai.com, kimbleai.com
âœ… **JavaScript Bundle**: Contains all new dashboard code (verified)
âœ… **API Endpoint**: `/api/agent/status?view=summary` working correctly
âœ… **Manifest.json**: Now accessible without authentication

### Issues Fixed

1. **Vercel Auto-Deployment**: GitHub integration wasn't triggering - now deploying manually via CLI
2. **manifest.json Error**: Added to public paths in middleware
3. **Empty Bundle**: Was a false alarm - bundle contains all code
4. **Google Login**: Fixed NextAuth route and environment variables

### Accessing the Dashboard

**URL**: `https://www.kimbleai.com/agent`

**Public Access**: The dashboard is set to PUBLIC in middleware, no login required

### If You Still See the Old Dashboard

**This is a browser cache issue.** The new dashboard IS deployed and live.

#### Clear Your Browser Cache:

**Option 1: DevTools Method (RECOMMENDED)**
1. Press `F12` to open DevTools
2. Click the **Application** tab (Chrome/Edge) or **Storage** tab (Firefox)
3. Click "**Clear site data**" or "**Clear Storage**"
4. Check all boxes (especially "Cache storage" and "Cached images and files")
5. Click "**Clear data**"
6. Close DevTools and hard refresh (`Ctrl + Shift + R`)

**Option 2: Manual Cache Clear**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Time range: "All time"
4. Click "Clear data"
5. Visit `https://www.kimbleai.com/agent`

**Option 3: Incognito Window**
- Open `https://www.kimbleai.com/agent` in a new incognito/private window
- You should see the new dashboard immediately

**Option 4: Different Browser**
- Try a browser you haven't used to visit the site

### Verification Test

Once you've cleared your cache, you should see:

1. **Four distinct columns** with colored borders (green, blue, orange, purple)
2. **Column headers**: "COMPLETED", "IN PROGRESS", "PENDING", "SUGGESTIONS"
3. **Stats boxes** at the top showing counts
4. **Project goals** in the purple Suggestions column
