## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Automatic File Reference**
```
User: "I need to review the budget document"
System Response:
"I found your Budget_2024_Q4.xlsx file in Google Drive (last modified 3 days ago).
Based on the content, it shows a total budget of $125,000 with 73% allocated to development.
Would you like me to open it or summarize the key financial metrics?"
```

### **Scenario 2: Cross-Source Context**
```
User: "What's my schedule today?"
System Response:
"You have 3 meetings today:
📅 9:00 AM - Team Standup (with Rebecca, John)
📅 2:00 PM - Client Review (Budget presentation - I see you have the latest budget file ready)
📅 4:00 PM - Project Planning

Also, you have 2 unread emails from the client about the budget review meeting."
```

### **Scenario 3: Proactive Project Management**
```
User: "How's the KimbleAI project going?"
System Response:
"KimbleAI project is 85% complete with 12 active tasks. Recent activity:
- 📧 Last client email 2 days ago requesting demo
- 📅 Demo scheduled for Friday at 3 PM
- 📄 Latest progress report in Drive shows all milestones on track
- 💬 Team discussed deployment in yesterday's Slack channel

Recommendation: Prepare demo materials and final testing checklist."
```

### **Scenario 4: Email Intelligence**
```
User: "Any important emails I should know about?"
System Response:
"3 high-priority emails in your inbox:
📧 Client feedback on proposal (requires response by tomorrow)
📧 Google Drive share notification for 'Project_Requirements.pdf'
📧 Calendar reminder for budget meeting moved to Wednesday

The client feedback relates to your current project - I can see the referenced documents are already in your Drive."
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Backend Architecture**
```
KimbleAI v4 Stack:
├── Next.js 14 (App Router)
├── Supabase (PostgreSQL + Vector)
├── OpenAI (GPT-4 + Embeddings)
├── Google APIs (Drive, Gmail, Calendar)
├── NextAuth.js (OAuth Security)
├── Zapier Pro (External Integrations)
└── Vercel (Production Deployment)
```

### **Auto-Reference System**
```typescript
// Automatic context gathering for every user message
const autoContext = await butler.gatherRelevantContext(
  userMessage,
  userId,
  conversationId,
  projectId
);

// Sources automatically checked:
// - Google Drive files
// - Gmail messages
// - Calendar events
// - Previous conversations
// - Project data
// - Knowledge base
// - Memory chunks
```

### **Vector Search Integration**
```sql
-- Automatic semantic search across all data
SELECT title, content, metadata,
       1 - (embedding <=> query_embedding) as similarity
FROM knowledge_base
WHERE user_id = $1
  AND 1 - (embedding <=> query_embedding) > 0.3
ORDER BY similarity DESC;
```
