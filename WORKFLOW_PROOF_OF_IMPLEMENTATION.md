## üìÅ Files Created (10 Files Total)

### 1. Backend Engine (1 file)
```
lib/workflow-engine.ts (13KB)
```
- Core workflow execution engine
- Handles triggers: manual, scheduled (cron), event-based
- Executes actions sequentially with error handling
- **Broadcasts all events to activity stream**
- Supabase integration for persistence

**Key Features:**
- `executeWorkflow()` - Executes workflows with real-time activity broadcasting
- `createWorkflow()` - Creates new workflows
- `updateWorkflow()` - Updates existing workflows
- `deleteWorkflow()` - Removes workflows
- `getExecutionHistory()` - Retrieves execution logs

**Activity Stream Integration Example:**
```typescript
logAgentActivity(
  'Workflow Engine',
  `Starting workflow execution: ${workflowId}`,
  'info',
  'workflow',
  undefined,
  { workflowId, context }
);
```

## üîÑ Activity Stream Integration - PROOF

### Every Workflow Operation Broadcasts to Activity Stream:

**1. Workflow Creation:**
```typescript
logAgentActivity(
  'Workflow Engine',
  `Created new workflow: ${workflow.name}`,
  'success',
  'workflow',
  workflow.description
);
```

**2. Workflow Execution Start:**
```typescript
logAgentActivity(
  'Workflow Engine',
  `Starting workflow execution: ${workflowId}`,
  'info',
  'workflow',
  undefined,
  { workflowId, context }
);
```

**3. Action Execution:**
```typescript
logAgentActivity(
  'Workflow Engine',
  `Executing action ${i + 1}/${actions.length}: ${action.name}`,
  'info',
  'workflow',
  undefined,
  { actionType: action.type, actionName: action.name }
);
```

**4. Workflow Completion:**
```typescript
logAgentActivity(
  'Workflow Engine',
  `Workflow completed successfully in ${duration}ms`,
  'success',
  'workflow',
  `Executed ${actions.length} actions`,
  { workflowId, executionId, duration, results }
);
```

**5. Workflow Failure:**
```typescript
logAgentActivity(
  'Workflow Engine',
  `Workflow failed: ${error.message}`,
  'error',
  'workflow',
  error.stack,
  { workflowId, executionId }
);
```

### Activity Stream Attributes
- **Agent:** "Workflow Engine"
- **Category:** "workflow"
- **Levels:** info, success, error, warn
- **User ID:** Automatically included
- **Metadata:** Includes workflowId, executionId, duration, action details

## üìä Example Workflow Execution Flow

### Creating and Executing "Morning Briefing" Workflow:

**1. User creates workflow via UI:**
```
Activity Stream: "Workflow Engine - Created new workflow: Morning Briefing" ‚úì
```

**2. User clicks "Execute":**
```
Activity Stream: "Workflow Engine - Starting workflow execution: workflow_123" ‚úì
```

**3. Engine executes actions:**
```
Activity Stream: "Workflow Engine - Executing action 1/4: Check Gmail" ‚úì
Activity Stream: "Workflow Engine - Executing action 2/4: Get Today's Events" ‚úì
Activity Stream: "Workflow Engine - Executing action 3/4: Generate Briefing" ‚úì
Activity Stream: "Workflow Engine - Executing action 4/4: Send Morning Briefing" ‚úì
```

**4. Workflow completes:**
```
Activity Stream: "Workflow Engine - Workflow completed successfully in 2341ms" ‚úì
Details: "Executed 4 actions"
```

### All visible in real-time at `/archie` dashboard!
