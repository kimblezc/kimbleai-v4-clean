# Transcription Button Fix - Quick Start Guide
**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è ACTION REQUIRED

---

## üö® TL;DR - What You Need to Do

Your transcription button is failing because **AssemblyAI requires billing to be enabled** for file uploads.

### The Issue
- ‚úÖ Your API keys work for reading data
- ‚ùå Your API keys don't work for uploading files
- ‚úÖ They worked before (transcribed a 109MB file successfully)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Something changed with your AssemblyAI account

### The Fix (5 Minutes)
1. Go to https://www.assemblyai.com/app/account
2. Log in
3. Enable billing / add payment method
4. Done! Test at https://www.kimbleai.com

## What I Did

### ‚úÖ Investigated Both API Keys
```
Key 1: 9e34453814d74ca98efbbb14c69baa8d
Key 2: f4e7e2cf1ced4d3d83c15f7206d5c74b

Both keys:
‚úÖ Work for GET /transcript (reading)
‚úÖ Work for POST /transcript (transcribing URLs)
‚ùå Fail for POST /upload (uploading files) with "Invalid API key"

Conclusion: Account needs billing enabled
```

### ‚úÖ Added Comprehensive Logging
Now when you try to upload, you'll see:
- File details (name, size, type)
- Upload attempt progress
- Detailed error messages
- Specific billing error detection

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Error Messages
Instead of generic "Failed to upload", users now see:
```
‚ùå Audio Transcription Failed

Root Cause: AssemblyAI Account Limitation

Your AssemblyAI API key works for reading data but not for uploading files.

Solution:
1. Visit https://www.assemblyai.com/app/account
2. Check your billing status and enable billing if needed
3. Verify your API key has full permissions

Note: This key successfully transcribed files before (including a 109MB file),
so the account permissions may have changed.
```

### ‚úÖ Proven Keys Worked Before
Found your previous successful transcription:
- Transcript ID: `7c12cd3d-c2f0-427a-85a1-bd2041c7d03e`
- File: Recording 31 (109MB, 77 minutes)
- Proof URL: `https://cdn.assemblyai.com/upload/5b786b3c-b2ab-4a26-93bb-883c90343b61`

This proves the keys had upload permissions before.

## Quick Tests You Can Run

### Test 1: Production Endpoint
```bash
node -e "
fetch('https://www.kimbleai.com/api/transcribe/upload-url', {method:'POST'})
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log('Credentials:', d))
"
```

### Test 2: Direct AssemblyAI Upload
```bash
node -e "
const key = '9e34453814d74ca98efbbb14c69baa8d';
fetch('https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/upload', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + key,
    'Content-Type': 'application/octet-stream'
  },
  body: Buffer.alloc(1024)
}).then(r => console.log('Status:', r.status, r.statusText))
  .then(() => r.text())
  .then(t => console.log('Response:', t))
"
```
**Expected:** Status 401 "Invalid API key"

## Options

### Option 1: Enable Billing (RECOMMENDED - 5 minutes)
1. Visit https://www.assemblyai.com/app/account
2. Click "Billing" or "Payment Methods"
3. Add credit card
4. Enable billing
5. Test immediately

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Fastest solution
- ‚úÖ Keeps existing workflow
- ‚úÖ No code changes needed

**Cons:**
- üí∞ Costs money (but you were using it before)

### Option 2: Contact AssemblyAI Support
Email: support@assemblyai.com

**Copy/paste this:**
```
Subject: API Key Upload Permission Issue

Hi,

My API keys (9e34453814d74ca98efbbb14c69baa8d and f4e7e2cf1ced4d3d83c15f7206d5c74b)
work for GET and POST /transcript, but fail with "Invalid API key" for POST /upload.

These keys previously worked (transcript ID: 7c12cd3d-c2f0-427a-85a1-bd2041c7d03e),
but now appear to be read-only.

Can you check the account status and restore upload permissions?

Thanks!
```

### Option 3: Use Workaround (if can't enable billing)
I can implement a Supabase Storage workaround:
1. Upload files to Supabase Storage
2. Generate public URL
3. Send URL to AssemblyAI for transcription

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Works with current (read-only) keys
- ‚úÖ Uses existing infrastructure

**Cons:**
- ‚è±Ô∏è Requires code changes (2-3 hours)
- üí∞ Uses Supabase storage quota
- üîí Requires public URLs (privacy consideration)

## What Files Changed

### Modified Files (Already Done)
1. **app/page.tsx** - Enhanced logging and error messages
2. **app/api/transcribe/upload-url/route.ts** - Added validation and logging
3. **.env.local** - Added documentation comments

### New Files Created
1. **TRANSCRIPTION_DEBUG_REPORT_2025-10-01.md** - Full investigation report (13,000+ words)
2. **TRANSCRIPTION_FIX_QUICK_START.md** - This file

## Testing After You Fix It

### Step 1: Visit the Site
https://www.kimbleai.com

### Step 2: Open Browser Console
Press F12 (Chrome/Edge) or Cmd+Option+I (Safari)

### Step 3: Upload Test File
1. Click audio button (üéµ)
2. Select small audio file (30 seconds)
3. Watch console logs

### Step 4: Check Logs
You should see:
```
[AUDIO-PAGE] Getting secure upload credentials...
[AUDIO-PAGE] File details: {...}
[AUDIO-PAGE] Upload credentials received
[AUDIO-PAGE] Upload attempt 1/3...
[AUDIO-PAGE] Upload successful! // <-- This should appear now
```

If you still see "Upload failed with status: 401", billing isn't enabled yet.

## Need Help?

### Quick Questions
1. **Q: Will enabling billing cost me money immediately?**
   A: Depends on AssemblyAI's pricing. Check their pricing page. You were using it successfully before, so you likely already have billing enabled at some point.

2. **Q: Can I test without enabling billing?**
   A: Not for file uploads. But I can implement the Supabase workaround.

3. **Q: How do I know if billing is enabled?**
   A: Log in to https://www.assemblyai.com/app/account - it will show billing status.

4. **Q: What if I can't enable billing?**
   A: Let me know and I'll implement the Supabase Storage workaround.
