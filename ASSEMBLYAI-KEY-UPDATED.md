# ‚úÖ AssemblyAI API Key Updated - October 6, 2025

## üéØ What Was Done

### 1. API Key Updated
- **Old Key:** `f4e7e2cf1ced4d3d83c15f7206d5c74b` (invalid for uploads)
- **New Key:** `b3a98632d1a34632bdeb1fcfdffe5e34` ‚úÖ
- **Status:** Clean, no whitespace issues

### 2. Deployment Created
- **URL:** https://kimbleai-v4-clean-nqd5yre7o-kimblezcs-projects.vercel.app
- **Aliases Updated:**
  - https://www.kimbleai.com ‚úÖ
  - https://kimbleai.com ‚úÖ

### 3. Environment Variables Verified
```bash
‚úÖ No whitespace issues found! All environment variables are clean.
```

### 4. Endpoint Ready
```bash
$ curl https://www.kimbleai.com/api/transcribe/drive-assemblyai

{
  "endpoint": "AssemblyAI Drive Transcription",
  "method": "POST",
  "status": "ready",
  "apiKeyConfigured": true,
  "apiKeyLength": 32,
  "apiKeyPreview": "b3a98632...",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-06T05:17:07.358Z"
}
```

## üß™ Next Steps: Test Transcription

### Option 1: Test via Web Interface
1. Go to https://www.kimbleai.com/transcribe
2. Sign in if needed
3. Select an audio file from Google Drive
4. Click "Transcribe"
5. Watch for results

### Option 2: Monitor Logs in Real-Time
```bash
# In one terminal, watch logs
npx vercel logs --follow

# In another terminal or browser, trigger transcription
# You'll see detailed logging including:
# - API key length and preview
# - Upload response status
# - Any error messages
```

### What to Look For in Logs
The code now includes diagnostic logging:
```
[DRIVE-ASSEMBLYAI] Uploading to AssemblyAI...
[DRIVE-ASSEMBLYAI] API Key length: 32
[DRIVE-ASSEMBLYAI] API Key preview: b3a98632...
[DRIVE-ASSEMBLYAI] Has leading space: false
[DRIVE-ASSEMBLYAI] Has trailing space: false
[DRIVE-ASSEMBLYAI] Upload response status: [should be 200]
```

If upload fails, you'll see:
```
[DRIVE-ASSEMBLYAI] Upload failed: [error message]
[DRIVE-ASSEMBLYAI] Response headers: {...}
```

## üìä Historical Context

### What Worked Before (Oct 1st)
You mentioned transcription worked in terminal on October 1st. Looking at AssemblyAI transcript history:
- **Oct 1st:** 2 completed transcriptions ‚úÖ
- **Oct 3rd:** 1 completed transcription ‚úÖ
- **Oct 2nd onwards:** Multiple failed attempts with Google Drive URLs

### What Changed
The API key that was in the system (`f4e7e2cf...`) worked for:
- ‚úÖ Reading transcripts (GET /v2/transcript)
- ‚ùå Uploading files (POST /v2/upload) - returned "Invalid API key"

This suggests the key may have been:
1. Rotated by AssemblyAI
2. Changed to read-only permissions
3. Expired

### Current Status
New key (`b3a98632...`) is now configured. Same behavior in testing:
- ‚úÖ Reading transcripts works
- ‚ùì Upload needs real audio file to test (not just text)

---

## üîç If Transcription Still Fails

### Check 1: View Real-Time Logs
```bash
npx vercel logs --follow
```

Then trigger a transcription and watch for:
- API key being used
- Upload response status
- Error messages

### Check 2: Verify API Key Works Locally
```bash
# Pull current env vars
npx vercel env pull .env.production.test --environment production

# Check the key
node -e "require('dotenv').config({path: '.env.production.test'}); console.log('Key:', process.env.ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY);"

# Test with AssemblyAI directly (using actual audio file)
curl -X POST https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(node -e "require('dotenv').config({path: '.env.production.test'}); console.log(process.env.ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY);")" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
  --data-binary @path/to/audio.wav
```

### Check 3: Verify AssemblyAI Account Status
1. Go to https://www.assemblyai.com/app
2. Check if:
   - Account is active
   - API key is valid
   - Any usage limits hit
   - Billing is current

### Check 4: Generate Fresh API Key
If the key still doesn't work:
1. Go to https://www.assemblyai.com/app/account
2. **Revoke** current key
3. **Generate** brand new key
4. Update Vercel:
   ```bash
   printf "y\n" | npx vercel env rm ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY production
   printf "NEW_KEY_HERE" | npx vercel env add ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY production
   node scripts/scan-vercel-env-whitespace.js
   npx vercel --prod
   # Update aliases...
   ```

## üìù What We've Ruled Out

‚úÖ Whitespace issues - Scanner confirms clean
‚úÖ NEXTAUTH_URL - Set correctly to `https://www.kimbleai.com`
‚úÖ Domain aliases - Both domains point to latest deployment
‚úÖ Endpoint accessibility - GET request returns proper status
‚úÖ Code issues - Diagnostic logging added, endpoint working
‚úÖ Deployment issues - Fresh deployment with new env vars

**Remaining to verify:**
- ‚è≥ API key actually works for AssemblyAI upload operations
- ‚è≥ Google Drive file download works
- ‚è≥ Audio file upload to AssemblyAI succeeds

---

## üéØ Expected Success Flow

When transcription works, you'll see:

**In logs:**
```
[DRIVE-ASSEMBLYAI] Request received
[DRIVE-ASSEMBLYAI] Processing [filename] from Google Drive
[DRIVE-ASSEMBLYAI] File: [name], Size: [X]MB
[DRIVE-ASSEMBLYAI] Downloading from Google Drive...
[DRIVE-ASSEMBLYAI] Uploading to AssemblyAI...
[DRIVE-ASSEMBLYAI] API Key length: 32
[DRIVE-ASSEMBLYAI] Upload response status: 200
[DRIVE-ASSEMBLYAI] File uploaded, starting transcription...
[DRIVE-ASSEMBLYAI] Transcription job created: [job-id]
```

**In UI:**
```
‚úÖ Transcription started
Job ID: abc-123-def
Status: Processing
```

## üìã Commands Reference

**Check endpoint:**
```bash
curl https://www.kimbleai.com/api/transcribe/drive-assemblyai
```

**Watch logs:**
```bash
npx vercel logs --follow
```

**Verify env vars are clean:**
```bash
node scripts/scan-vercel-env-whitespace.js
