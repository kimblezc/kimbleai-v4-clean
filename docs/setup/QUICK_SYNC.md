# Quick Sync Checklist

Since your laptop already has VS Code, OneDrive, and the project - just do this:

## On Laptop

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project (OneDrive should have synced it)
cd D:\OneDrive\Documents\kimbleai-v4-clean

# 2. Pull latest changes
git pull

# 3. Install any new dependencies
npm install

# 4. Verify setup
npx tsx scripts/verify-setup.ts

# 5. Done! Start coding
npm run dev
```

That's it - you're synced!
