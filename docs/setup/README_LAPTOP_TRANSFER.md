## On Your Laptop - Super Quick Start

Since you already have VS Code and OneDrive set up:

```bash
# 1. Wait for OneDrive to sync (or force sync the project folder)
# 2. Open terminal in project directory
cd D:\OneDrive\Documents\kimbleai-v4-clean

# 3. Pull latest changes
git pull

# 4. Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# 5. Verify everything works
npx tsx scripts/verify-setup.ts

# 6. Done! Start coding
npm run dev
```

That's literally it - 5 commands and you're ready.

## What I Created for You

### Quick Reference Docs
1. **QUICK_SYNC.md** ⚡ - START HERE (ultra-simple checklist)
2. **CURRENT_STATE.md** 📊 - Everything we fixed today + system status
3. **SYNC_TO_LAPTOP.md** 💻 - Detailed sync guide
4. **LAPTOP_SETUP.md** 🛠️ - Full setup (if you ever need it)

### Tools
5. **scripts/verify-setup.ts** ✅ - Checks all environment vars & connections
6. **.env.local.template** 🔐 - Template for environment variables

## What You Need on Laptop

Since OneDrive syncs the project folder, you should already have:
- ✅ All code files (via OneDrive)
- ✅ All documentation (via git/OneDrive)

You might need to verify:
- ⚠️ `.env.local` file (OneDrive may sync it, but verify it has your secrets)
- ⚠️ `node_modules` (run `npm install` to be safe)

---

## Quick Verification

After syncing, run this ONE command to verify everything:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/verify-setup.ts
```

It checks:
- ✅ All environment variables present
- ✅ Supabase connection working
- ✅ OpenAI API accessible
- ✅ Database tables accessible
- ✅ Archie agent can run

If it passes, you're 100% ready to go!

## What's Currently Running

**Archie Status** (as of 2:00 PM today):
- 🟢 GitHub Actions triggering every 5 minutes
- 🟢 87 pending tasks being processed
- 🟢 43 tasks completed today
- 🟢 Dashboard showing real-time data

**Latest Fixes** (deployed today):
- ✅ Task processing bug fixed (NULL scheduled_for)
- ✅ Vercel Crons replaced with GitHub Actions
- ✅ Dashboard caching fixed
- ✅ Manual trigger endpoint created

Everything is working perfectly right now!

## If Something's Not Working

### Environment Variables Missing?
```bash
# Pull from Vercel
vercel login
vercel link
vercel env pull .env.local
```

### Can't Connect to Database?
- Check `.env.local` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- Restart VS Code terminal after adding env vars

### Need to See What Changed?
Read `CURRENT_STATE.md` - it has everything we did today.
