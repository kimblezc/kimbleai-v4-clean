  "suggestedProject": "...",
  "photoId": "..."
}
```

  "success": true,
  "analysis": "...",
  "metadata": {...},
  "autoTags": [...],
  "suggestedProject": "...",
  "photoId": "...",
  "knowledgeBaseId": "uuid-here",
  "vectorSearchEnabled": true,
  "rag": {
    "stored": true,
    "searchable": true,
    "message": "Photo analysis stored in knowledge base and available for semantic search"
  }
}
```

## Security Enhancements

Added validation for:
1. Filename sanitization (path traversal prevention)
2. Analysis type whitelist
3. Enhanced input validation

---

## Integration with Existing Systems

### WorkspaceRAGSystem
- Photos now part of unified memory system
- Searchable via `search_knowledge_base()`
- Compatible with compression/optimization

### BackgroundIndexer
- Can reference photo analysis in conversations
- Cross-modal knowledge linking
- Automatic importance scoring

### Chat System
- Photos discoverable in conversation context
- "Remember that error message photo?" works
- Project-based photo retrieval

---

## Usage Examples

### 1. Semantic Search for Photos
```sql
SELECT * FROM search_knowledge_base(
  query_embedding,
  'user-uuid',
  20,
  'photo-analysis',
  'file'
);
```

### 2. Find Photos by Tag
```sql
SELECT * FROM knowledge_base
WHERE 'error' = ANY(tags)
  AND category = 'photo-analysis';
```

### 3. Project-Based Retrieval
```sql
SELECT * FROM knowledge_base
WHERE metadata->>'project_category' = 'development'
  AND category = 'photo-analysis';
```

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM knowledge_base
WHERE category = 'photo-analysis';

-- Test 2: Check embeddings
SELECT id, title FROM knowledge_base
WHERE category = 'photo-analysis'
  AND embedding IS NOT NULL;

-- Test 3: Tag distribution
SELECT unnest(tags) as tag, COUNT(*)
FROM knowledge_base
WHERE category = 'photo-analysis'
GROUP BY tag ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```
