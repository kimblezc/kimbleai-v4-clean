I just rebooted to reconnect Google Drive with M4A audio files for transcription.

CURRENT SITUATION (Oct 6, 2025):
- Latest deployment: kimbleai-v4-clean-itro02wyx-kimblezcs-projects.vercel.app
- Domains: www.kimbleai.com and kimbleai.com are configured
- AssemblyAI API key b3a98632d1a34632bdeb1fcfdffe5e34 is READ-ONLY (GET works, POST uploads fail with 401)
- Google Drive was disconnected, I just rebooted to reconnect

CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND:
Test endpoint shows API key is read-only:
curl https://www.kimbleai.com/api/test-assemblyai
Result: test2_ListTranscripts=200 OK, test3_Upload=401 "Invalid API key"

IMMEDIATE TASKS:
1. Help me verify Google Drive is now connected at https://www.kimbleai.com/transcribe
2. Help me generate and configure a new FULL-ACCESS AssemblyAI API key
3. Test transcription flow with M4A files

Let's start by checking if Google Drive is connected, then fix the AssemblyAI key.
