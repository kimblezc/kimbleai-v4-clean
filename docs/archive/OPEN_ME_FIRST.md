## ✅ IMPORTANT: NO DUPLICATION

**Desktop today:** Built core infrastructure (database, search, file processing)
**Laptop previous:** Built 12 intelligent agents (Drive Intelligence, Audio Intelligence, etc.)

**They work TOGETHER - zero duplication!**

See: `NO_DUPLICATION_CONFIRMED.md` for details.

## ⚡ 3-MINUTE SUMMARY

**What's done:**
- ✅ Database deployed to Supabase
- ✅ All infrastructure code written
- ✅ Production live at kimbleai.com
- ✅ 12 agents already running (from laptop work)

**What you do:**
