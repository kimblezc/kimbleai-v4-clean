## What Are Projects?

Projects in KimbleAI help you organize conversations by topic, client, or category - just like ChatGPT's project feature.

## How It Works (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Creating a Project

**In the Sidebar:**
1. Look for the "PROJECTS" section
2. Click "+ New project"
3. Enter project name (e.g., "Travel Planning", "Work", "Learning German")
4. Click OK
5. ✅ Project appears in sidebar

**Example Projects:**
- 🌍 Travel Planning
- 💼 Work Projects
- 📚 German Language Learning
- 🎯 Fitness & Health
- 💰 Financial Planning

### 2. Selecting a Project

**Before Starting a Conversation:**
1. Click the project name in the sidebar (e.g., "Travel Planning")
2. The project name becomes highlighted
3. Now any new conversation will be assigned to this project

**Visual Indicator:**
- Selected project: White text on gray background
- Unselected project: Gray text

### 3. Starting a Project Conversation

**Once a project is selected:**
1. Click "New chat" button
2. Type your message
3. ✅ Conversation is automatically assigned to the selected project

**Example:**
```
Selected Project: Travel Planning
User: "What are the best beaches in Bali?"
→ This conversation is now part of "Travel Planning" project
```

### 4. Viewing Project Conversations

**In the Sidebar:**
- Scroll down to see conversations grouped by project
- Each project section shows:
  - Project name in UPPERCASE
  - Count of conversations (e.g., "TRAVEL PLANNING (5)")
  - List of conversations under that project

**Example Sidebar:**
```
PROJECTS
├─ General (no project selected)
├─ Travel Planning (5)
│  ├─ Best beaches in Bali
│  ├─ Flight options to Thailand
│  ├─ Hotel recommendations Tokyo
│  └─ ...
├─ Work Projects (12)
│  ├─ Q4 2024 Planning
│  ├─ Client meeting notes
│  └─ ...
```

### 5. Project Header in Chat

**When viewing a conversation with a project:**
- You'll see a big header at the top
- Shows project name in large text
- Shows conversation count
- Looks like ChatGPT's project header

**Example:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  🌍  Travel Planning             │
│      5 conversations             │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

User: What are the best beaches in Bali?
AI: Bali has many beautiful beaches...
```

### 6. Managing Projects

**Rename a Project:**

2. Click the ✏️ (pencil) button next to it
3. Enter new name
4. Click OK
5. ✅ Project renamed

**Delete a Project:**
1. Find the project in sidebar
2. Click the 🗑️ (trash) button next to it
3. Confirm deletion
4. ✅ Project deleted (conversations become "General")

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Work vs Personal Chats
```
1. Create "Work" project
2. Create "Personal" project
3. Select "Work" → Start new chat about quarterly report
4. Select "Personal" → Start new chat about vacation planning
5. All work chats grouped under "Work" in sidebar
6. All personal chats grouped under "Personal" in sidebar
```

### Scenario 2: Client Projects
```
1. Create project for each client (e.g., "Acme Corp", "TechStart Inc")
2. Select "Acme Corp" before chatting about their project
3. All Acme Corp conversations grouped together
4. Easy to find all conversations with that client
```

### Scenario 3: Learning Topics
```
1. Create "German Language" project
2. Create "Python Programming" project
3. Create "History" project
4. Each learning topic keeps its own conversation history
5. No mixing of different subjects
```

## Key Points to Remember

✅ **Select project BEFORE starting new conversation**
- The selected project determines where the conversation goes
- If no project selected → conversation goes to "General"

✅ **Existing conversations stay where they are**
- Selecting a project doesn't move old conversations
- Only affects NEW conversations

✅ **Conversations are grouped in sidebar**
- Scroll down to see all project groups
- Each project shows its conversation count

✅ **Project header shows in chat**
- Big visual header when viewing project conversations
- Just like ChatGPT's project feature

## Pro Tips

💡 **Tip 1**: Create projects BEFORE you start chatting about a topic
- This ensures all conversations are properly organized from the start

💡 **Tip 2**: Use descriptive project names
- "Q4 2024 Planning" is better than "Work Stuff"

💡 **Tip 3**: Don't create too many projects
- 5-10 well-organized projects is better than 50 scattered ones

💡 **Tip 4**: Use the project header to verify
- When you start a new chat, check the header to confirm it's in the right project

💡 **Tip 5**: Review and clean up periodically
- Delete old projects you're no longer using
- Keep your sidebar clean and organized
