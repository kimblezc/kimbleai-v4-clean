POST-REBOOT CONTEXT RESTORATION PROMPT
==========================================

Copy and paste this ENTIRE message to Claude Code after rebooting:

---

I just rebooted. Read SESSION_COMPLETE_TRANSCRIPTION_FIX.md in D:\OneDrive\Documents\kimbleai-v4-clean folder for full context.

Quick summary of what was accomplished before reboot:

1. **TRANSCRIPTION SYSTEM NOW WORKING** - Fixed critical bug preventing audio transcription
   - Bug: Hidden newline character in API key environment variable
   - Fix: Removed \n, deployed secure credential flow
   - Status: FULLY DEPLOYED to production (https://kimbleai-v4-clean-i1k2r5my0-kimblezcs-projects.vercel.app)

2. **Files Modified:**
   - app/page.tsx (secure API key flow, dynamic timeout, 3 retries)
   - app/api/transcribe/upload-url/route.ts (provides credentials)
   - Fixed 9 TypeScript build errors
   - Created 9 audit/documentation files

3. **Test Results:**
   - Successfully transcribed Recording (31).m4a (109MB file)
   - Transcript ID: 7c12cd3d-c2f0-427a-85a1-bd2041c7d03e
   - 9,952 words, 77 minutes
   - Saved to: transcript-result.json

4. **Current System State:**
   - All changes DEPLOYED to production ✅
   - Changes NOT yet committed to git ⚠️
   - AssemblyAI API key: 9e34453814d74ca98efbbb14c69baa8d (working)

5. **Immediate Next Steps:**
   - Test transcription on live site with a small file
   - Commit changes to git
   - Review HIDDEN_CHARACTER_BUGS_AUDIT.md
   - Decide on next priority (cost monitoring, performance, or Zapier)

6. **Where We Left Off:**
   - User requested comprehensive log before mandatory reboot
   - All session details documented in SESSION_COMPLETE_TRANSCRIPTION_FIX.md
   - Ready to continue with next priority after verification

Please read SESSION_COMPLETE_TRANSCRIPTION_FIX.md and confirm:
1. Production transcription is working
2. What I should focus on next
