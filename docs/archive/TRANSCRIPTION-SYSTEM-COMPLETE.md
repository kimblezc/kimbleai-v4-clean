# ✅ Audio Transcription System - Fully Functional

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Status:** PRODUCTION READY

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### 1. AssemblyAI Integration Fixed
- **Issue:** API key had READ-ONLY permissions
- **Solution:** New API key with full upload permissions (`b33ccce950894067b89588381d61cddb`)
- **Fix:** Removed "Bearer" prefix from Authorization headers (AssemblyAI doesn't use it)
- **Result:** ✅ Uploads and transcriptions working perfectly

### 2. Speaker Labels & Timestamps
- **Before:** Monolithic text block with no structure
- **After:** Formatted output with:
  ```
  [2:34] Speaker A: This is what they said...
  [2:45] Speaker B: This is the response...
  ```
- **Location:** `app/page.tsx:405-424`

### 3. Export Functionality
Created complete export system with 4 options:

#### Download Formats:
1. **TXT** - Clean formatted text with timestamps and speakers
2. **JSON** - Full metadata including words, tags, action items
3. **SRT** - Subtitle format for video editing

#### Google Drive Integration:
4. **Save to Drive** - Auto-saves with optional categorization
   - Prompts for category folder name
   - Creates "Transcriptions - [Category]" folder
   - Saves formatted transcript with auto-tags and action items

### Files Created:
- `/api/transcribe/export/route.ts` - Export API with multiple formats
- `/api/transcribe/save-to-drive/route.ts` - Google Drive integration
- Global export functions in `app/page.tsx:184-230`

## 🎨 User Experience

### Transcription Flow:
1. User uploads M4A/MP3/WAV file (up to 2GB supported)
2. Progress bar shows upload → transcription → processing
3. Formatted result appears with:

   - Action items
4. **4 export buttons** appear below transcript:
