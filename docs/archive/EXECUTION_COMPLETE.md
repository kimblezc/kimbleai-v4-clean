## ✅ WHAT'S CONFIRMED

### RAG System Status: FULLY INTACT ✅

**Critical Confirmation:** Your existing RAG vector search is **100% preserved and enhanced**.

**What's the same:**
- `lib/embeddings.ts` - Core embedding system
- `lib/embedding-cache.ts` - Cost optimization
- `app/api/knowledge/search/route.ts` - RAG search API
- `search_all_content()` - Database function (shared)
- All vector embeddings
- All knowledge base data

**What's new:**
- `app/api/search/semantic/route.ts` - Additional search API
- Simple GET interface for quick searches
- Performance metrics and tracking

**Architecture:**
```
Both APIs → Same embeddings → Same database function → Same results
```

They complement each other, not replace.

# Verify database
npx tsx scripts/verify-database.ts

# Test all systems
npx tsx scripts/test-all-systems.ts

# Use API test collection
# Open: test-api.http in VS Code
```
