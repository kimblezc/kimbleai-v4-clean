PROMPT TO GIVE CLAUDE ON LAPTOP
========================================

Copy-paste this into Claude Code when you resume:

---

I'm continuing the kimbleai v4 Phase 1 deployment from my desktop session.

Current status:
- ✅ Database deployed successfully to Supabase
- ✅ Vector search functions working (search_all_content, get_search_stats)
- ✅ All code written: semantic search API, file upload, file processing
- ✅ RAG system verified intact and working
- ✅ All documentation complete

Remaining tasks (15 minutes):
1. Create Supabase Storage buckets: "files" (private) and "thumbnails" (public)
2. Test semantic search and file APIs locally
3. Deploy to Vercel production
4. Verify deployment

Key files to reference:
- CONTINUE_HERE.md - Quick start guide
- SESSION_LOG.md - What happened in desktop session
- STORAGE_SETUP.md - Storage bucket instructions
- DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md - Step-by-step deployment

Please help me complete the remaining deployment steps.

ALTERNATIVE SHORT VERSION:
---

Continue from desktop session. Database deployed ✅. Need to:
1. Create storage buckets (files, thumbnails)
2. Test APIs locally
3. Deploy to production

See CONTINUE_HERE.md for details. Phase 1 is 85% complete.
