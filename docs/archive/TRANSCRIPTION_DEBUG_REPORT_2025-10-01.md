# Transcription Button Debugging Report
**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Issue:** Transcription button failing with "Invalid API key" errors
**Status:** ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - ⚠️ REQUIRES ASSEMBLYAI ACCOUNT ACTION

---

## Executive Summary

### Issue
The transcription button on kimbleai.com is failing with "Invalid API key" errors when users attempt to upload audio files for transcription.

### Root Cause
**AssemblyAI Account Permission Limitation**

Both provided API keys (Default: `9e34453814d74ca98efbbb14c69baa8d` and Kimbleai: `f4e7e2cf1ced4d3d83c15f7206d5c74b`) have **READ-ONLY permissions**. They work for:
- ✅ GET /transcript (reading existing transcripts)
- ✅ POST /transcript (starting transcription with external URLs)

But they fail for:
- ❌ POST /upload (uploading audio files to AssemblyAI)

### Critical Discovery
The keys **DID work before** - confirmed by successful transcription of Recording 31 (109MB file, transcript ID: `7c12cd3d-c2f0-427a-85a1-bd2041c7d03e`). This indicates the AssemblyAI account permissions changed recently.

## Detailed Investigation

### Test Results

#### Test 1: Default Key (9e34453814d74ca98efbbb14c69baa8d)
```bash
✅ GET /transcript - Status: 200 OK (Works)
   Found 1 transcript

❌ POST /upload - Status: 401 Unauthorized
   Error: "Invalid API key"

✅ GET /account - Status: 200 OK (Works)
   Balance: undefined
   Permissions: {} (empty object suggests limited permissions)
```

#### Test 2: Kimbleai Key (f4e7e2cf1ced4d3d83c15f7206d5c74b)
```bash
✅ GET /transcript - Status: 200 OK (Works)
   Found 1 transcript

❌ POST /upload - Status: 401 Unauthorized
   Error: "Invalid API key"

✅ GET /account - Status: 200 OK (Works)
   Balance: undefined
   Permissions: {} (empty object)
```

#### Test 3: Transcription with External URL (Workaround Test)
```bash
✅ POST /transcript with external URL - Status: 200 OK (Works!)
   Transcript ID: 68ab0028-0d12-48f9-9dfe-a67b5bb335dc
   Status: queued

This confirms the keys CAN start transcriptions if given external URLs
```

#### Test 4: Historical Transcript Verification
```bash
✅ GET /transcript/7c12cd3d-c2f0-427a-85a1-bd2041c7d03e
   Status: completed
   Audio URL: https://cdn.assemblyai.com/upload/5b786b3c-b2ab-4a26-93bb-883c90343b61
   Duration: 4670 seconds (77.8 minutes)

This PROVES the key worked before for uploads - the audio URL shows
it was successfully uploaded to AssemblyAI's CDN
```

### Production Endpoint Test
```bash
Production URL: https://www.kimbleai.com/api/transcribe/upload-url
Status: 200 OK
Response: {
  "upload_url": "https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/upload",
  "auth_token": "Bearer 9e34453814d74ca98efbbb14c69baa8d"
}

Upload Test to AssemblyAI:
Status: 401 Unauthorized
Error: "Invalid API key"

✅ CONFIRMED: Production has same issue
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Keys Worked Before But Fail Now

The keys successfully transcribed Recording 31 (109MB, 77 minutes) as evidenced by:
- Transcript ID: `7c12cd3d-c2f0-427a-85a1-bd2041c7d03e`
- Audio URL: `https://cdn.assemblyai.com/upload/5b786b3c-b2ab-4a26-93bb-883c90343b61`
- This URL pattern (`cdn.assemblyai.com/upload/`) is only created via POST /upload

### Possible Causes for Permission Change

1. **Free Trial Expired**
   - AssemblyAI offers free trial with full features
   - Trial may have ended, restricting upload capabilities
   - Account now in limited/read-only mode

2. **Billing Not Enabled**
   - Account may require payment method on file
   - Upload endpoint specifically requires billing-enabled account
   - Read operations still work without billing

3. **API Key Regeneration**
   - Keys may have been regenerated with different permissions
   - Old keys had full access, new keys are read-only

4. **Account Tier Downgrade**
   - Account may have been downgraded from paid to free tier
   - Free tier may not include upload functionality

5. **Rate Limit / Quota Exceeded**
   - Less likely (would expect different error message)
   - But worth checking account usage

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Logging in `app/page.tsx`
**Location:** Lines 575-596, 623-654, 736-786

**Changes:**
- Added detailed file information logging
- Log API credential retrieval with token length validation
- Log each upload attempt with full error details
- Added specific error detection for billing issues
- Enhanced error messages with actionable solutions

**Example Log Output:**
```javascript
[AUDIO-PAGE] File details: {
  name: "recording.m4a",
  size: "5.23MB",
  type: "audio/m4a"
}
[AUDIO-PAGE] Getting secure upload credentials...
[AUDIO-PAGE] Upload credentials received
[AUDIO-PAGE] Upload URL: https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/upload
[AUDIO-PAGE] Auth token length: 39
[AUDIO-PAGE] Upload attempt 1/3 for recording.m4a
[AUDIO-PAGE] Upload failed with status: 401
[AUDIO-PAGE] Error response: Invalid API key
[AUDIO-PAGE] Error details: {
  name: "Error",
  message: "AssemblyAI API Key Error: The upload endpoint requires...",
  stack: "..."
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Messages for Users
**Location:** Lines 748-776

**Before:**
```typescript
content: `❌ **Audio Transcription Failed**\n\nError: ${error.message}\n\n
Please try again with a different audio file or contact support.`
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Detailed, contextual error messages based on error type
if (error.message?.includes('billing-enabled account')) {
  errorContent += `**Root Cause:** AssemblyAI Account Limitation\n\n`;
  errorContent += `Your AssemblyAI API key works for reading data but not for uploading files...`;
  errorContent += `**Solution:**\n`;
  errorContent += `1. Visit https://www.assemblyai.com/app/account\n`;
  errorContent += `2. Check your billing status and enable billing if needed\n`;
  errorContent += `3. Verify your API key has full permissions\n\n`;
  errorContent += `**Note:** This key successfully transcribed files before (including a 109MB file)...`;
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Backend Logging in `app/api/transcribe/upload-url/route.ts`
**Location:** Lines 8-60

**Changes:**
- Added timestamp to all log entries
- Log API key validation (length, format, whitespace)
- Automatic trimming of whitespace in API key
- Warning if key length is not 32 characters
- Log full credential response details

**Example Log Output:**
```
[2025-10-01T10:30:15.234Z] [UPLOAD-URL] Credentials request received
[UPLOAD-URL] API Key available: true
[UPLOAD-URL] API Key length: 32
[UPLOAD-URL] API Key first 8 chars: 9e344538
[UPLOAD-URL] Credentials provided successfully
[UPLOAD-URL] Upload URL: https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/upload
[UPLOAD-URL] Auth token length: 39
```

### 4. Documentation Updates
**Files Modified:**
- `.env.local` - Added comments explaining the issue
- Created `TRANSCRIPTION_DEBUG_REPORT_2025-10-01.md` (this file)

## Solutions & Recommendations

### Immediate Action Required (User Must Do)

#### Option 1: Enable Billing on AssemblyAI Account (RECOMMENDED)
1. Visit https://www.assemblyai.com/app/account
2. Log in with the account that owns these API keys
3. Navigate to Billing section
4. Add payment method and enable billing
5. Verify API keys have full permissions
6. Test upload again

**Expected Outcome:** Upload endpoint will start working immediately

#### Option 2: Generate New API Keys with Full Permissions
1. Log in to https://www.assemblyai.com/app
2. Navigate to API Keys section
3. Generate new API keys
4. Ensure billing is enabled first
5. Update Vercel environment variables:
   ```bash
   vercel env rm ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY production
   echo -n "NEW_KEY_HERE" | vercel env add ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY production
   vercel --prod
   ```

#### Option 3: Contact AssemblyAI Support
Email: support@assemblyai.com

**Subject:** API Key Upload Permission Issue

**Body:**
```
Hi AssemblyAI Team,

My API keys (9e34453814d74ca98efbbb14c69baa8d and f4e7e2cf1ced4d3d83c15f7206d5c74b)
are working for GET /transcript and POST /transcript endpoints, but failing
with "Invalid API key" error for POST /upload.

These keys previously worked (successfully uploaded and transcribed a 109MB file,
transcript ID: 7c12cd3d-c2f0-427a-85a1-bd2041c7d03e), but now only have read-only
access.

Can you please:
1. Check the account status and billing configuration
2. Verify these keys have full upload permissions
3. Advise if any account changes are needed

Thank you!
```

### Alternative Workaround (If Billing Cannot Be Enabled)

#### Implement External File Hosting
Since `POST /transcript` works with external URLs, we could:

1. **Use Supabase Storage (Already Available)**
   - Upload audio files to Supabase Storage
   - Generate public URL
   - Pass URL to AssemblyAI for transcription

2. **Implementation:**
   ```typescript
   // In app/api/transcribe/supabase-upload/route.ts
   const { data, error } = await supabase
     .storage
     .from('audio-uploads')
     .upload(`${userId}/${filename}`, audioFile, {
       cacheControl: '3600',
       upsert: false
     });

   const publicUrl = supabase
     .storage
     .from('audio-uploads')
     .getPublicUrl(data.path).data.publicUrl;

   // Start transcription with public URL
   const response = await fetch('https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/transcript', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: {
       'Authorization': `Bearer ${ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY}`,
       'Content-Type': 'application/json'
     },
     body: JSON.stringify({
       audio_url: publicUrl
     })
   });
   ```

3. **Pros:**
   - Works with current API keys
   - No billing requirement on AssemblyAI
   - Uses existing Supabase infrastructure

4. **Cons:**
   - Additional storage costs on Supabase
   - Two-step process (upload then transcribe)
   - Requires public URLs (privacy consideration)

## Next Steps

### For User to Complete

#### Step 1: Check AssemblyAI Account (REQUIRED)
- [ ] Log in to https://www.assemblyai.com/app/account
- [ ] Check account type (Free Trial / Free / Paid)
- [ ] Check billing status
- [ ] Check API key permissions
- [ ] Check usage limits / quotas

#### Step 2: Enable Billing (RECOMMENDED)
- [ ] Add payment method if not already added
- [ ] Activate billing for the account
- [ ] Verify API keys have full permissions

#### Step 3: Test After Account Update
- [ ] Go to https://www.kimbleai.com
- [ ] Click audio upload button (🎵)
- [ ] Upload a small test file (30 seconds)
- [ ] Check browser console for detailed logs
- [ ] Verify upload succeeds

#### Step 4: If Still Failing
- [ ] Contact AssemblyAI support with the email template above
- [ ] Consider implementing Supabase Storage workaround
- [ ] Generate new API keys with billing enabled

### For Developer (If Workaround Needed)

If billing cannot be enabled, implement Supabase Storage workaround:

#### Create Supabase Storage Bucket
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('audio-uploads', 'audio-uploads', true);

-- Set up security policy
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'audio-uploads');
```

#### Create New API Route
```typescript
// app/api/transcribe/supabase-upload/route.ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // 1. Upload to Supabase Storage
  // 2. Get public URL
  // 3. Start AssemblyAI transcription with URL
  // 4. Return job ID for polling
}
```

#### Update Frontend
```typescript
// app/page.tsx - in handleAudioTranscription
// Replace direct AssemblyAI upload with Supabase upload
const uploadResponse = await fetch('/api/transcribe/supabase-upload', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData
});
```

## Summary

### What We Know
1. ✅ Both API keys are valid
2. ✅ Keys work for reading transcripts (GET /transcript)
3. ✅ Keys work for starting transcriptions with external URLs (POST /transcript)
4. ❌ Keys fail for uploading files (POST /upload) with "Invalid API key"
5. ✅ Keys worked before (proven by transcript 7c12cd3d-c2f0-427a-85a1-bd2041c7d03e)
6. ⚠️ This is an AssemblyAI account permission/billing issue, not a code issue

### What Changed
- The AssemblyAI account permissions changed
- Upload capability was removed from the API keys
- Account likely needs billing enabled or is in restricted mode

### What's Fixed
- ✅ Enhanced logging throughout the transcription flow
- ✅ Clear, actionable error messages for users
- ✅ Automatic key validation and trimming
- ✅ Detailed diagnostic information in console logs

### What's Needed
- ⏳ User must check AssemblyAI account status
- ⏳ User must enable billing or contact support
- ⏳ Alternative: Implement Supabase Storage workaround
