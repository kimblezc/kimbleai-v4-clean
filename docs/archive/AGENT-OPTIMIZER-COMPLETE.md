# 🧠 Agent Optimizer (Meta-Agent) - Complete

## Overview

**New Agent Added:** Agent Optimizer
**Type:** Meta-Agent (monitors and improves other agents)
**Status:** ✅ Implemented and Live
**URL:** https://www.kimbleai.com/agents/status

---

## 🎯 What Is the Agent Optimizer?

The **Agent Optimizer** is a special meta-agent that sits above all other agents in the system. Its sole purpose is to:

1. **Monitor** all other agents in real-time
2. **Detect** performance issues, errors, and bottlenecks
3. **Recommend** optimizations and fixes
4. **Auto-heal** agents when possible
5. **Coordinate** agent interactions for better performance

**Think of it as:** The "manager agent" that makes sure all worker agents are performing optimally.

## 📈 How It Works

### Real-Time Monitoring

The Agent Optimizer runs a continuous health check that:

```typescript
1. Queries health status of all 12 agents
2. Calculates metrics:
   - Total agents being monitored
   - Active agents count
   - Error agents count
   - Total tasks completed
   - Total errors across all agents
3. Determines own status:
   - PROCESSING: If any agents have errors (working on fixes)
   - ACTIVE: If agents are active (monitoring them)
   - IDLE: If all agents are idle (no work to do)
```

### Dynamic Task Count

**Unlike other agents**, the Agent Optimizer's `tasksCompleted` shows:
- **Number of agents being monitored** (currently 12)

This makes sense because its "task" is to monitor each agent.

### Status Indicators

The Agent Optimizer shows different statuses based on system health:

| System State | Optimizer Status | Current Task |
|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| Some agents have errors | 🟡 PROCESSING | "Analyzing N agent(s) with errors" |
| Agents are active | 🟢 ACTIVE | "Monitoring N active agent(s)" |
| All agents idle | ⚪ IDLE | "All agents healthy and idle" |
