## Activity Stream Integration

All workflow operations broadcast events to the activity stream:

### Logged Events
1. **Workflow Creation** - Broadcasts when workflow is created
2. **Workflow Execution Start** - Logs workflow execution initiation
3. **Action Execution** - Logs each action as it executes
4. **Workflow Completion** - Logs success with duration and results
5. **Workflow Failure** - Logs errors with details
6. **Workflow Update** - Logs changes to workflow configuration
7. **Workflow Deletion** - Logs workflow removal

### Activity Stream Categories
- **Category:** `workflow`
- **Levels:** `info`, `success`, `error`, `warn`
- **Agent:** `Workflow Engine`

### Real-time Broadcasting
All events are immediately visible in:
- Archie activity stream dashboard
- Real-time notification system
- Database logs for historical analysis

---

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Workflow via UI

1. Navigate to `/workflows`
2. Click "Create Workflow" button
3. Enter workflow name and description
4. Select trigger type (Manual, Scheduled, or Event)
5. Configure trigger settings (cron expression or event type)
6. Add actions:
   - Click "Add Action"
   - Select action type (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Notification, AI Analysis, Create Task)
   - Configure action-specific settings
   - Repeat for multiple actions
7. Click "Save Workflow"

### Using a Template

1. Navigate to `/workflows`
2. Click "Templates" tab
3. Browse available templates
4. Click "Use Template" on desired template
5. Workflow is created (disabled by default)
6. Edit and customize as needed
7. Enable when ready

### Executing a Workflow

**Manual Execution:**
1. Find workflow in dashboard
2. Ensure workflow is enabled (toggle switch)
3. Click "Execute" button
4. Watch real-time progress in activity stream

**Automated Execution:**
- Scheduled workflows run automatically based on cron expression
- Event-based workflows trigger on configured events
- All executions are logged with full history

```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/workflows', {

3. Create a test workflow using the UI
4. Execute the workflow
5. Check the activity stream for real-time updates
6. Verify workflow appears in the dashboard

### Activity Stream Verification
All workflow events should appear in:

### Example Workflow Execution
1. Create "Test Notification" workflow
2. Add a single notification action
3. Enable the workflow
4. Click "Execute"
5. Should see in activity stream:
   - "Starting workflow execution..."
   - "Executing action 1/1: New Action"
   - "Workflow completed successfully in Xms"
