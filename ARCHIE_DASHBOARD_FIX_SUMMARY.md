# Archie Dashboard - Comprehensive Analysis & Fixes

**Date:** October 26, 2025
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Agents running but not producing new work

---

## 🔍 Problems Identified

### 1. **NO NEW AGENT ACTIVITY FOR 4 DAYS**
- **Last Task Created:** October 21, 2025 (5 days ago)
- **Agents ARE Running:** Logs show execution today at 8:56 AM
- **Root Cause:** Error and performance monitoring are FAILING
  - Missing `api_logs` table in database
  - Agents can't detect new issues without this table
  - No new tasks being created

### 2. **DASHBOARD UNREADABLE**
- **Font too small:** 13px text in low contrast gray (#9ca3af)
- **Text truncated:** Descriptions cut off mid-sentence
- **Generic titles:** All tasks named "Improvement Suggestion"
- **No timestamps:** Can't see when agents last ran
- **No activity log:** No visibility into what agents are doing

### 3. **ALL TASKS MARKED COMPLETED**
- 105 tasks all showing as "completed"
- 0 pending tasks
- 0 in-progress tasks
- Agents have nothing to work on

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Dashboard UI Improvements**
✅ Increased font size from 13px → 14px
✅ Changed color from #9ca3af (gray) → #d1d5db (lighter gray)
✅ Added `whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap'` to show full text
✅ Added `wordBreak: 'break-word'` to prevent overflow
✅ Increased line-height from 1.5 → 1.6 for better readability

### 2. **Added Live Activity Status**
✅ Shows last agent activity timestamp
✅ Color-coded status (green if <1 hour, red if stale)
✅ Shows total completed tasks and findings
✅ Displays minutes since last activity

### 3. **Added Recent Activity Log**
✅ Shows last 20 agent log entries
✅ Displays log level, timestamp, message, and details
✅ Color-coded by severity (red=error, yellow=warn, green=info)
✅ Shows full JSON details for debugging
✅ Scrollable with max height 400px

### 4. **Improved Data Fetching**
✅ Limited completed tasks to last 20 (was showing all 105)
✅ Added total counts for context
✅ Fetching recent logs for activity feed
✅ Changed "Suggestions" to "All Findings" (more accurate)

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Actions Required

### **IMMEDIATE (Required for agents to work):**

1. **Create `api_logs` table in Supabase**
   - Location: `database/api-logs-schema.sql` (created)
   - Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor
   - Without this table, error/performance monitoring fails

2. **Test Dashboard**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/agent
   - Verify text is readable
   - Check activity log shows recent entries
   - Confirm last activity timestamp is correct

3. **Manually Trigger Agents**
   - Test: `/api/agent/cron?trigger=archie-now`
   - Should create new findings and tasks
   - Verify they appear on dashboard

### **HIGH PRIORITY:**

4. **Fix Generic Task Titles**
   - Current: All tasks say "Improvement Suggestion"
   - Should use actual description as title
   - Update in `lib/autonomous-agent.ts` line 448-451

5. **Add Manual Trigger Buttons**
   - Add buttons to dashboard to manually run each agent
   - Helps with testing and debugging
   - Format: `<button onClick={() => fetch('/api/agent/cron?trigger=archie-now')}>Run Agent</button>`

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY:**

6. **Implement API Request Logging**
   - Add middleware to log all API requests to `api_logs` table
   - Capture: endpoint, method, response time, status code, errors
   - This enables error and performance monitoring

7. **Test All 4 Agents**
   - Autonomous Agent (`/api/agent/cron`)
   - Archie Utility (`/api/cron/archie-utility`)
   - Drive Intelligence (`/api/cron/drive-intelligence`)
   - Device Sync (`/api/cron/device-sync`)

## 🔧 Agent Schedule (Vercel Cron)

| Agent | Schedule | Last Run | Status |
|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Autonomous Agent** | Every 5 min | Today 8:56 AM | ✅ Running |
| **Archie Utility** | Every 15 min | Unknown | ⚠️ Needs testing |
| **Drive Intelligence** | Every 6 hours | Unknown | ⚠️ Needs testing |
| **Device Sync** | Every 2 min | Unknown | ⚠️ Needs testing |

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Dashboard is useful when:
- ✅ Text is readable (14px+, good contrast)
- ✅ Full descriptions visible (no truncation)
- ✅ Activity timestamps show freshness
- ✅ Log viewer shows what agents are doing
- ⏳ Agents detect and create new tasks (requires api_logs table)
- ⏳ Manual trigger buttons work
- ⏳ All 4 agents run successfully

---

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Run SQL to create api_logs table**
2. **Test dashboard at http://localhost:3000/agent**
3. **Manually trigger autonomous agent**
4. **Verify new findings/tasks appear**
5. **Add manual trigger buttons**
6. **Implement API logging middleware**

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Generic task titles** - All say "Improvement Suggestion" instead of actual content
2. **Missing api_logs table** - Prevents error/performance monitoring
3. **No manual triggers** - Can't test agents without waiting for cron
4. **No API logging** - Can't track actual API errors/performance

---

**Files Modified:**
- `app/agent/page.tsx` - Dashboard UI improvements
- `database/api-logs-schema.sql` - New table schema (needs to be run)

**Files To Modify Next:**
- `lib/autonomous-agent.ts` - Fix generic task titles (line 448-451)
- `app/agent/page.tsx` - Add manual trigger buttons
- `middleware.ts` or new middleware - Add API logging

**Dashboard Preview:**
- http://localhost:3000/agent (after dev server starts)
