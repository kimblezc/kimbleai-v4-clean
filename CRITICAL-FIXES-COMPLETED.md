# ✅ Critical Fixes Completed - October 3, 2025

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Transcription System - FIXED
**Problem:** Transcription was failing with "Daily usage limit exceeded" and Drive URL auth issues

**Solution:**
- Created new endpoint `/api/transcribe/drive-assemblyai` that:
  - Downloads files from Google Drive (no auth issues)
  - Uploads to AssemblyAI (handles multi-GB files)
  - Returns job ID for polling
- Fixed daily limit checker to use database (not in-memory cache that resets)
- Increased limits: 50 hours/$25 per day

**Status:** 🟢 WORKING
- Deployed to: https://www.kimbleai.com/transcribe
- Test it: Click "🎤 Transcribe" on any audio file in your Drive

---

### 2. ✅ Cost Monitoring Dashboard - CREATED
**Problem:** No way to view cost limits or status per day/hour/use

**Solution:**
- Created `/costs` page with real-time monitoring
- Shows: Hourly, Daily, Monthly usage with color-coded progress bars
- Displays recent API calls with model, endpoint, tokens, cost
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- Budget alerts when approaching limits

**Status:** 🟢 LIVE
- Access: https://www.kimbleai.com/costs
- Or click "💰 Cost Monitor" from main page sidebar

**What You'll See:**
```
Hourly Usage:  $0.00 / $10.00 limit    (0% used)
Daily Usage:   $0.00 / $50.00 limit    (0% used)
Monthly Usage: $0.00 / $500.00 limit   (0% used)

Recent API Calls: [Table showing all API usage]
```

### 3. ⚠️ Semantic Search - NEEDS ONE MANUAL STEP
**Problem:** Need confirmation that semantic search works with RAG and vector

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Knowledge base has 275 entries
- ✅ Embeddings ARE being stored (verified)
- ✅ Vector column exists in database
- ❌ Search function `match_knowledge_base` doesn't exist YET

**To Complete:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gbmefnaqsxtoseufjixp/sql/new
2. Copy/paste SQL from `create-semantic-search-function.sql`
3. Click "Run"

**After that:**
- Semantic search will work
- RAG will use vector similarity
- Search will find relevant content by meaning (not just keywords)

**Test Command:**
```bash
node test-semantic-search.js
```

## 🚀 What's Working Now

### Transcription Flow:
1. Visit https://www.kimbleai.com/transcribe
2. Browse Google Drive folders
3. Click "🎤 Transcribe" on any audio file
4. Watch real-time progress
5. Transcription auto-saves to knowledge base
6. Speaker labels, action items, entities extracted

### Cost Monitoring Flow:
1. Visit https://www.kimbleai.com/costs
2. See hourly/daily/monthly usage
3. View recent API calls
4. Get alerts when approaching limits
5. Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds

### Knowledge Base:
- 275 entries stored
- Embeddings generated for semantic search
- Vector similarity ready (after SQL function added)
- Searchable by meaning (not just keywords)

## ⏭️ Remaining Critical Tasks

### High Priority
1. **Add semantic search function** (1 minute - SQL in `create-semantic-search-function.sql`)
2. **Test Drive write access** (create/modify files)
3. **Make health/status endpoints public** (remove auth requirement)

### Medium Priority
4. **Device continuity dashboard** (show sync status, session history)
5. **Clean up test pages** (move auth-test, test-upload, simple to /test)
6. **Check Zapier Pro utility** (is it being used? worth $20/month?)

### Low Priority
7. **Create canonical schema doc** (consolidate 32 SQL files)
8. **Test Gmail integration** (exists but untested)
9. **Test Calendar integration** (exists but untested)
