  "changelog": "💰 HYBRID COST OPTIMIZATION: Implemented cost-optimized hybrid Archie schedule - V1 runs every 12 hours for simple fixes (lint/dead code/patches @ $5.08/mo), V2 runs daily at 3AM for complex AI-powered fixes with learning ($5.22/mo). Total cost: $10.30/month (92% reduction from $125/month hourly). Both versions tracked in database with full V2 dashboard oversight. Smart scheduling maintains code quality while dramatically reducing OpenAI/Claude costs.",
