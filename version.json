  "lastUpdated": "2025-11-16T06:15:00.000Z",
  "changelog": "feat: Projects functionality fully operational - (1) Verified all database tables exist (projects, project_tasks, project_collaborators). (2) Verified conversation-to-project linking works (code already implemented). (3) Added 'Assign to Project' context menu for existing conversations. (4) Added visual project indicator below chat input (shows current project selection). (5) Created comprehensive documentation (PROJECTS_DIAGNOSTIC_REPORT.md, PROJECTS_USER_GUIDE.md). Projects system is 100% functional: create/edit/delete projects, auto-link new conversations, group by project in sidebar, ChatGPT-style project headers. Issue was UX clarity, not broken functionality. ~100 lines added.",
