  "changelog": "🔔 TOAST NOTIFICATIONS & AUTOSAVE: Comprehensive UX feedback system implemented across entire application. Added react-hot-toast Toaster component with dark theme styling (top-right position, 5s duration, color-coded icons). Toast notifications integrated into: useMessages (send success/error), FileUploader (upload progress + completion), useProjects (create/update/delete feedback), useConversations (delete/create notifications). Created useAutosave hook with 2s delay, localStorage persistence, draft restoration on mount. Integrated autosave in main chat with draft loading (shows 'Draft restored' toast) and auto-clear on send. All user actions now provide immediate visual feedback. ~300 lines added across 6 files (1 new hook, 5 modified).",
