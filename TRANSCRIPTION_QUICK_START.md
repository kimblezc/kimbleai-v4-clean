# Transcription System - Quick Start Guide

## ‚úÖ What's Fixed

Your transcription system now includes:

1. **Speaker Separation** - Automatically detects and labels different speakers (Speaker A, Speaker B, etc.)
2. **4-File Google Drive Upload** - Exports everything you need in one organized folder
3. **Smart Organization** - Files organized by date and transcription name
4. **Comprehensive Metadata** - Full JSON with all details, timestamps, and speaker stats

## üìÅ The 4 Files Explained

### File 1: Original Audio (your-audio-name.m4a)
- Your original audio file
- Same quality as uploaded
- Play it anytime

### File 2: full-transcription.txt
Complete transcript with timestamps and speaker labels.

**Example:**
```
TRANSCRIPTION: team-meeting.m4a
Duration: 15:42
Date: 1/24/2025, 10:30:00 AM

================================================================================

[0:00] Speaker A: Welcome everyone to today's standup.
[0:15] Speaker B: Thanks, I'll start with my updates.
[0:45] Speaker A: Great, how's the API integration going?
[1:20] Speaker B: Almost done, should be ready by Friday.
```

### File 3: speaker-separated.txt
Same content but grouped by speaker for easier reading.

**Example:**
```
SPEAKER-SEPARATED TRANSCRIPTION: team-meeting.m4a
Duration: 15:42
Date: 1/24/2025, 10:30:00 AM

================================================================================

--- SPEAKER A ---

[0:00] Welcome everyone to today's standup.
[0:45] Great, how's the API integration going?
[2:30] Perfect, let's move to the next topic.

--- SPEAKER B ---

[0:15] Thanks, I'll start with my updates.
[1:20] Almost done, should be ready by Friday.
[3:15] I agree with that approach.
```

### File 4: metadata.json
Complete data including speaker statistics, all timestamps, and metadata.

**Example:**
```json

## üí° Tips & Tricks

### Better Speaker Separation
- Use high-quality audio (avoid background noise)
- Ensure speakers don't talk over each other
- Use separate microphones if possible
- Avoid music/background audio

### Organizing Transcriptions
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., "client-call-acme-2025-01-24.m4a")
- Files auto-organize by date
- Each transcription gets its own folder

### Finding Transcriptions
- Search by date: `/Transcriptions/2025-01-24/`
- Search by name: Use Google Drive search
- Check metadata.json for keywords/tags

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Export failed: No Google Drive file ID found"
**Solution**: Make sure you transcribed the audio from the `/transcribe` page (not uploaded directly)

### "Only 3 files exported (missing audio)"
**Solution**: The original audio must be in Google Drive. If you uploaded locally, only 3 files will export.

### "Speaker separation not working"
**Possible causes:**
- Audio quality too poor
- Only one speaker
- Speakers talking over each other constantly

**Solution**: Try with clearer audio or accept the full transcript without speaker labels

### "Authentication expired"
**Solution**: Sign out and sign back in to refresh your Google OAuth token

### Daily Limits

- **$25** daily cost limit
- Automatically enforced

### File Size
