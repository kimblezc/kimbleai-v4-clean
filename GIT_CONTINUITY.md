# KIMBLEAI V4 - PROJECT CONTINUITY LOG
**Last Updated:** September 22, 2025

## CURRENT STATUS
- **Deployment:** https://kimbleai-v4-clean.vercel.app
- **Completion:** 90% (missing Google integration)
- **Critical Fix Applied:** Cross-conversation memory retrieval

## WHAT WORKS
✅ Chat interface with GPT-4o-mini  
✅ User isolation (Zach/Rebecca)  
✅ File uploads (TXT/MD/CSV)  
✅ Knowledge extraction  
✅ Vector search with RAG  
✅ Automated deployment  

## WHAT'S BROKEN
❌ Cross-conversation memory (FIX APPLIED - needs deployment)  
❌ PDF parsing (pdf-parse incompatible)  
❌ Google Drive integration (not started)  
❌ Gmail integration (not started)  

## STOP DOING THIS
- Creating new projects (you have 5+ versions)
- Rebuilding from scratch
- Switching to complex architectures (Fibery, multi-agent systems)
- Adding more tools (you have enough)

## DO THIS INSTEAD
1. Deploy the memory fix
2. Test if memory works
3. Add Google OAuth (follow GOOGLE_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md)
4. Stop when it works

## THE REAL ISSUE
You have ONE SQL query bug preventing memory from working across conversations. Everything else works. Stop rebuilding and just fix this one issue.

## GIT COMMANDS FOR CONTINUITY
```bash
# Always check current state first
git status
git log --oneline -10

# Deploy fixes
git add -A
git commit -m "Clear description of fix"
git push origin main

# If deployment fails
vercel logs
```

## REMEMBER
- The system is 90% complete
- You're fixing bugs, not rebuilding
- Google integration is the only missing feature
- Everything else is working or has workarounds
