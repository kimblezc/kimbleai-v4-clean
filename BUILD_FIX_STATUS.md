# BUILD FAILURE FIX - STATUS UPDATE
**Date:** September 21, 2025  
**Time:** 10:00 AM

## ERRORS FIXED

### Error 1: Const Reassignment
- **Problem:** Line 60 trying to reassign `userData` which was declared as const
- **Solution:** Changed to `let userData: any = null` to allow reassignment

### Error 2: Missing Module
- **Problem:** `@/lib/knowledge-extractor` module didn't exist
- **Solution:** Embedded knowledge extraction directly in route.ts

## CURRENT STATUS

- ✅ TypeScript errors fixed
- ✅ Knowledge extraction integrated inline
- ✅ File upload simplified
- ⏳ Awaiting redeployment

## FILES MODIFIED

1. `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Fixed const issue, embedded extraction
2. `app/api/upload/route.ts` - Removed dependency on knowledge-extractor

## NEXT STEP

Run: `.\DEPLOY_FIXED.ps1`

This will push the fixes and redeploy to Vercel.
