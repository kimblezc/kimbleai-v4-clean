### ⚠️ AGENTS WITH LIMITED IMPLEMENTATION

#### 5. **Knowledge Graph Agent** ⭐⭐⭐
**Status:** PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION
**Value:** MODERATE

**What It Does:**
- Entity extraction
- Relationship mapping
- Semantic search
- Graph visualization

**Reality Check:**
- Services exist: `lib/knowledge-graph.ts`, `lib/entity-extraction.ts`
- Database tables: `knowledge_base` (using this as primary source)
- UI: `components/agents/KnowledgeGraphDashboard.tsx`, `KnowledgeGraphViz.tsx`
- **BUT:** Limited evidence of actual entity/relationship extraction in practice

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ **NEEDS WORK** - Good concept but implementation appears shallow. Real knowledge graphs need proper entity resolution and relationship inference.

---

**Value:** MODERATE

**What It Does:**
- Project state tracking
- Context awareness
- Project classification
- Progress monitoring

**Reality Check:**
- Services: `lib/project-manager.ts`, `lib/project-semantic-integration.ts`
- Database: `projects` table with basic CRUD
- **BUT:** "Context awareness" and "semantic integration" appear more aspirational than functional

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ **SIMPLIFY OR ENHANCE** - Either make this truly intelligent or simplify to basic project management

---

### ❌ AGENTS THAT ARE MOSTLY CONCEPTUAL

#### 7. **Workflow Automation Agent** ⭐
**Status:** PLANNED (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
**Value:** POTENTIALLY HIGH (IF IMPLEMENTED)

**What It Claims:**
- Workflow creation
- Pattern-based automation
- Multi-step execution
- Learning & optimization

**Reality Check:**
- Listed in agent registry with "planned" status
- Database schema exists: `database/workflow_automation_schema.sql`
- **NO ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION** - No services, no APIs, no UI
- Health check queries empty `workflows` table

**Recommendation:** ❌ **REMOVE OR IMPLEMENT** - This is vaporware. Either build it properly or remove from agent list.

---

#### 8. **Cleanup Agent** ⭐
**Status:** ON-DEMAND TOOL (NOT AN AGENT)
**Value:** LOW (UTILITY, NOT INTELLIGENCE)

**What It Claims:**
- Git cleanup
- Storage optimization
- Cache management

**Reality Check:**
- This is just a utility script, not an "intelligent agent"
- Status: "Available on demand" (i.e., not running)
- Features all marked as "planned"

**Recommendation:** ❌ **REMOVE FROM AGENT LIST** - This is a maintenance utility, not an AI agent. Move to /scripts/

---

#### 9. **Agent Optimizer (Meta-Agent)** ⭐⭐
**Status:** MONITORING ONLY
**Value:** LOW (BASIC HEALTH CHECKS)

**What It Claims:**
- Performance monitoring
- Error pattern detection
- Auto-healing
- Optimization recommendations

**Reality Check:**
- Only implements basic health checks by querying other agents
- No actual "optimization" or "auto-healing"
- Endpoints: `/api/agents/monitor`, `/api/agents/optimize`
- **Features marked as "partial" or "planned"** - Not truly optimizing anything

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ **RENAME TO "AGENT MONITOR"** - It's a status dashboard, not an optimizer. Set expectations correctly.

---

#### 10. **Deep Research Agent** ⭐⭐⭐
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED BUT LIMITED
**Value:** MODERATE

**What It Does:**
- Multi-step research planning
- Web search (simulated with GPT)
- Source analysis
- Report generation

**Reality Check:**
- Implementation exists: `lib/deep-research-agent.ts`
- **CRITICAL FLAW:** Uses GPT to simulate web searches instead of real search APIs
- Comment in code: "This is a placeholder - replace with actual search API"
- Generates synthetic search results, not real ones

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ **FIX SEARCH IMPLEMENTATION** - Replace GPT-simulated searches with real search APIs (Google Custom Search, Bing, or SerpAPI) or this provides no value.
