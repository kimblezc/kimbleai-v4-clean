## 🎯 Autonomous Behavior Validation

### ✅ What Archie Did Automatically (No Human Intervention):

1. **Read PROJECT_GOALS.md** and created 6 priority tasks
2. **Analyzed each task** using GPT-4o
3. **Generated implementation plans** for 4 tasks
4. **Created 19 findings** through proactive bug hunting
5. **Completed 5 tasks** end-to-end
6. **Generated daily report** with executive summary
7. **Logged all actions** (50+ detailed entries)
8. **Marked tasks complete/in-progress** appropriately
9. **Tracked subtask progress** (e.g., 2/5 complete)

### ⏭️ What Archie Skipped (By Design in Serverless):

1. File modification (read-only filesystem)
2. Test execution (runs during Vercel build)
3. Git operations (commits/pushes)

**Reasoning:** These operations require local development environment. In production, Archie:
- Generates code suggestions as Findings
- Logs what would be changed
- Allows developer to review and apply manually

---

## 📈 Dashboard Validation

### Expected Dashboard Display:

**Tasks Tab:**
- Should show 6 tasks with priority badges
- Progress bars showing subtask completion (e.g., 40% = 2/5)
- Status icons (⏸️ ✅ 🔄)
- Phase indicators (Planning → Implementation → Testing → Deployment)

**Findings Tab:**
- Should show 19 findings with severity color-coding
- 4 code generation findings with expandable evidence
- Improvement suggestions
- Performance recommendations

**Technical Logs Tab:**
- Should show 50+ log entries
- Timestamp, level, and message
- Expandable details for context

**Reports Tab:**
