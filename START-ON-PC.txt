STATUS: Railway migration in progress - MCP bug needs fixing

================================================================
STEP 1: Pull Latest Code
================================================================

Open any terminal and run:

cd C:\Users\zachk\OneDrive\Documents\kimbleai-v4-clean
git pull origin master

(This gets you commit f8b8748 with HANDOFF.md)

================================================================
STEP 2: Read The Handoff
================================================================

Open HANDOFF.md in Claude Code or any editor

It contains EVERYTHING:
- What we accomplished (Railway migration)
- The bug we found (MCP client not connecting)
- How to fix it (persistent client connections)
- All deployment info
- Next steps

================================================================
STEP 3: Setup Railway CLI
================================================================

railway login
railway link
  -> Select: kimbleai
  -> Select: production

================================================================
STEP 4: Tell Claude Code
================================================================

Open Claude Code and say:

"Read HANDOFF.md and let's continue fixing the MCP client bug.
The issue is in lib/mcp/mcp-server-manager.ts line 411-421.
We need to implement persistent client connections."

================================================================
THAT'S IT!
================================================================

The ONE file you need: HANDOFF.md
It has everything for context continuity.
