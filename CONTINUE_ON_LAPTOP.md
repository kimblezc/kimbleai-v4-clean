**PROMPT FOR CLAUDE CODE:**

```
I'm continuing development of KimbleAI from my desktop session.

Context:
- Project: KimbleAI v4 (Next.js 15.5.3, TypeScript, Tailwind, Supabase)
- Location: ~/OneDrive/Documents/kimbleai-v4-clean
- Latest commit: 4995856
- Status: All UI improvements deployed to kimbleai.com

Recent changes (this session):
1. Complete ChatGPT-style UI redesign (reduced from 1348 to 442 lines)
2. Added Inter + Space Grotesk fonts (readable but distinctive)
3. Fixed D20 glow to radiate from center with soft gradient
4. Added personalized time-based greetings in CET timezone
5. Created automated session handoff system

Please:
1. Read SESSION_HANDOFF.md to understand the current state
2. Verify all changes are synced (git status should be clean)
3. Run a build test to ensure everything works: npm run build
4. Let me know we're ready to continue, and ask what I'd like to work on next

If there are any uncommitted changes or issues, help me resolve them.
```

## üìã Alternative: Use the Sync Script

If you prefer automation:

```bash
cd ~/OneDrive/Documents/kimbleai-v4-clean

# Linux/Mac
./scripts/laptop-sync.sh

# Windows
.\scripts\laptop-sync.ps1
```

The sync script will:
- Pull latest changes from GitHub
- Install dependencies if needed
- Rebuild the project
- Show session handoff summary

---

## üìñ Key Files to Know

- `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` - Complete session state and changes
- `scripts/README.md` - Documentation for all scripts
- `app/page.tsx` - Main UI (442 lines, recently redesigned)
- `app/globals.css` - Global styles and fonts

npm run lint             # Run linter

# Git
git status               # Check current state
git log --oneline -10    # See recent commits

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **OneDrive Sync**: Files sync automatically, but git history requires manual pull
2. **Environment Variables**: `.env.local` may need to be recreated on laptop (not in git)
3. **Node Modules**: Will need `npm install` first time (not in OneDrive sync)
4. **Build Cache**: `.next` folder can be deleted and rebuilt

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**If sync script fails:**
```bash
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
npm install
npm run build
```

**If build fails:**
```bash
rm -rf .next node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

**If you need to restore old UI:**
```bash
git checkout app/page.tsx.backup-dnd-theme
```

**Ready to continue! Use the prompt above in Claude Code on your laptop.**
