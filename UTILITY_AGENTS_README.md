## 3. Device Sync Agent
**File**: `lib/device-sync-agent.ts` (20KB)

### Purpose
Enable seamless cross-device continuity and conflict-free synchronization.

### Capabilities

#### 3.1 Real-Time Device Sync
- **Sync frequency**: On-demand or scheduled
- **Active device detection**: Last heartbeat within 10 minutes
- **Sync types**:
  - Context (scroll position, current message)
  - Conversation state
  - Settings/preferences
  - Project updates
  - File references

**Data synced**:
```typescript
{
  activeConversation: "conv_123",
  scrollPosition: 450,
  currentMessage: "Draft message content...",
  preferences: { theme: "dark", fontSize: 14 }
}
```

#### 3.2 Conflict Detection
- **Conflict types**:
  - Conversation edits from multiple devices within 5 minutes
  - Settings changes from different devices
  - Project updates with timing overlap
- **Detection window**: 5 minutes
- **Resolution strategy**: Keep latest timestamp (configurable)

**Example Conflict**:
```
Type: conversation_edit
Resource: conv_abc123
Device A: iPhone (2025-10-25 14:30:15)
Device B: MacBook (2025-10-25 14:30:42)
Resolution: Keep latest (Device B)
```

#### 3.3 Conflict Resolution
- **Default strategy**: Keep latest timestamp
- **Alternative strategies**:
  - Merge (for non-conflicting fields)
  - Manual review (for critical resources)
- **Logging**: All conflicts logged to `agent_findings`

#### 3.4 Continuity Suggestions
- **"Continue on..." suggestions**: When conversation started on Device A, suggest continuing on Device B
- **Project resumption**: Suggest resuming work on different device
- **Confidence scoring**: Based on context similarity and recency

**Example Suggestion**:
```
Type: continue_conversation
Title: Continue conversation on MacBook
Description: You were working on "API Integration Planning" on iPhone. Continue on MacBook?
Confidence: 85%
Conversation ID: conv_xyz789
```

#### 3.5 Offline Sync Queue
- **Queue mechanism**: Tasks stored when device offline
- **Priority levels**: 1-10 (higher = more urgent)
- **Auto-retry**: Failed syncs retried on next run
- **Cleanup**: Synced tasks older than 3 days removed

**Queue Entry**:
```typescript
{
  id: "sync_abc123",
  type: "context",
  priority: 7,
  status: "pending",
  fromDevice: "iphone_xyz",
  toDevice: null, // broadcast to all
  payload: { scrollPosition: 300 },
  createdAt: "2025-10-25T14:30:00Z"
}
```

#### 3.6 Cross-Device State Management
- **State persistence**: Device sessions stored in `device_sessions`
- **Heartbeat tracking**: 10-minute activity window
- **Context snapshots**: Saved to `context_snapshots`
- **Settings sync**: Unified across all active devices

### Usage

```typescript
import { DeviceSyncAgent } from '@/lib/device-sync-agent';

const agent = DeviceSyncAgent.getInstance();
const result = await agent.run(userId);

console.log(`Processed ${result.syncsProcessed} sync tasks`);
console.log(`Detected ${result.conflictsDetected} conflicts`);
console.log(`Generated ${result.suggestionsGenerated} suggestions`);

// Queue offline sync
await agent.queueOfflineSync(
  userId,
  deviceId,
  'context',
  { scrollPosition: 450 },
  priority: 7
);
```

### Database Integration
- **Device sessions**: `device_sessions`
- **Sync queue**: `sync_queue`
- **Context snapshots**: `context_snapshots`
- **Preferences**: `device_preferences`
- **Logs**: `agent_logs` (category: 'device-sync')
- **Findings**: `agent_findings` (conflicts and suggestions)

## Integration with Existing System

### Agent Tables
All three agents integrate with existing `autonomous-agent-schema.sql` tables:

- **`agent_tasks`**: Tasks created by Archie Utility Agent
- **`agent_findings`**: Insights from all three agents
- **`agent_logs`**: Execution logs from all agents
- **`agent_reports`**: Weekly reports from Drive Intelligence Agent

### Singleton Pattern
All agents use `getInstance()` pattern for memory efficiency:

```typescript
const archie = ArchieUtilityAgent.getInstance();
const drive = DriveIntelligenceAgent.getInstance();
const sync = DeviceSyncAgent.getInstance();
```

### Error Handling
All agents:
- Catch and log errors
- Continue execution on individual failures
- Return partial results if some checks fail
- Log to database for audit trail

---

## Scheduling Recommendations

### Archie Utility Agent
- **Frequency**: Every 6 hours
- **Best time**: Off-peak hours (2 AM, 8 AM, 2 PM, 8 PM)
- **Reason**: Conversation patterns accumulate throughout the day

### Drive Intelligence Agent
- **Frequency**: Weekly (Sunday 2 AM)
- **Best time**: Low-usage period
- **Reason**: Drive API rate limits, intensive analysis

### Device Sync Agent
- **Frequency**: Every 5 minutes (active users only)
- **Best time**: Continuous during user activity
- **Reason**: Real-time sync requires frequent execution

---

## Production Deployment

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your-service-role-key>
```

### Cron Jobs (using Vercel Cron or similar)

**vercel.json**:
```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/utility-agent",
      "schedule": "0 */6 * * *"
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/drive-intelligence",

    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/device-sync",
      "schedule": "*/5 * * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

### API Endpoints (create these)

**`app/api/cron/utility-agent/route.ts`**:
```typescript
import { ArchieUtilityAgent } from '@/lib/archie-utility-agent';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function GET() {
  const agent = ArchieUtilityAgent.getInstance();
  const result = await agent.run();
  return NextResponse.json(result);
}
```

**`app/api/cron/drive-intelligence/route.ts`**:
```typescript
import { DriveIntelligenceAgent } from '@/lib/drive-intelligence-agent';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function GET() {
  // Get all users with Google Drive connected
  // Run agent for each user
  return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
}
```

**`app/api/cron/device-sync/route.ts`**:
```typescript
import { DeviceSyncAgent } from '@/lib/device-sync-agent';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function GET() {
  // Get all users with active devices
