# Node.js 22 Successfully Deployed! ✅

## Status: Complete

**Version**: v6.1.1
**Commit**: 605cc5b
**Node Version**: v22.17.1 (confirmed on Railway)
**Deployment**: https://www.kimbleai.com

## What Was Fixed

### Problem 1: Wrong Nix Package Name
- First attempt used `nodejs-22_x` (invalid)
- Build failed with: `error: undefined variable 'nodejs-22_x'`
- **Fix**: Changed to `nodejs_22` in nixpacks.toml

### Problem 2: Node 18 Causing Warnings
- Previous deployment used Node 18.20.5
- Caused "Unsupported engine" warnings for MCP packages
- Supabase deprecation warning about Node 18
- **Fix**: .nvmrc + nixpacks.toml to force Node 22

## Verification ✅

```bash
railway run node --version
# Output: v22.17.1
```

```bash
railway logs --lines 200 | grep -i "supabase\|unsupported\|engine"
# Output: (empty - no warnings!)
```

**Before (Node 18):**
```
⚠️  Node.js 18 and below are deprecated...
npm warn EBADENGINE Unsupported engine {
npm warn EBADENGINE   package: 'lru-cache@11.2.2',
npm warn EBADENGINE   required: { node: '20 || >=22' },
npm warn EBADENGINE   current: { node: 'v18.20.5', npm: '10.8.2' }
```

**After (Node 22):**
```
✅ No warnings
✅ Container starts successfully
✅ All packages compatible
```

## Files Changed

### Commit 34c7331 (Initial attempt)
- Created `.nvmrc` with `22`
- Created `nixpacks.toml` with `nodejs-22_x` (wrong)

### Commit 605cc5b (Fix)
- Updated `nixpacks.toml` to use `nodejs_22` (correct)

### Final nixpacks.toml:
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs_22"]

[phases.build]
cmds = ["npm ci", "npm run build"]

[phases.start]
cmd = "npm start"

[variables]
NODE_ENV = "production"
```

## Next Steps: Test MCP Servers

The automated test suite shows 401 (Unauthorized) because MCP endpoints require authentication. You need to **test manually in browser**.

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Go to**: https://www.kimbleai.com/integrations/mcp
2. **Log in** with Google OAuth
3. **Check server status**:
   - Filesystem: Should show "Connected" with tool count > 0
   - GitHub: Should show "Connected" with tool count > 0
   - Memory: Should show "Connected" with tool count > 0

4. **Test functionality**:
   - Go to chat: https://www.kimbleai.com
   - Try: "Remember that my favorite color is blue"
   - Refresh page or open in new tab
   - Try: "What's my favorite color?"
   - **Expected**: Should remember (using Memory MCP)
   - **Previous bug**: Would forget immediately

5. **Check for fallbacks**:
   - Try asking about files in your Google Drive
   - **Expected**: Should use MCP filesystem tools
   - **Previous bug**: Would fall back to Google Drive API

### Check Railway Logs for Errors:

If servers still show 0 tools or 500 errors:

```bash
railway logs --lines 100 | grep -i "mcp-connect\|error"
```

Look for:
- Connection failures
- Process spawn errors
- Permission issues
- Stack traces

## Success Criteria

✅ Node 22.17.1 confirmed active
✅ No "Unsupported engine" warnings
✅ No Supabase Node 18 deprecation warning
⏳ MCP servers showing connected with tools > 0
⏳ Memory server actually storing/retrieving data
⏳ Filesystem server being used (not Drive API fallback)

## Commits

- **34c7331**: Initial Node 22 config (failed build)
- **605cc5b**: Fixed Nix package name to nodejs_22 (success)

## Related Fixes

This completes the three-part fix for MCP:

1. **Persistent MCPClient instances** (commit 1448b6c)
   - Fixed 0 tools bug by reusing connected clients

2. **Enhanced logging** (commit c0ea14c)
   - Added detailed error diagnostics for 500 errors

3. **Node 22.x upgrade** (commit 605cc5b)
   - Fixed package compatibility warnings
   - Ensures MCP packages run on supported Node version

All three combined should fully resolve the MCP functionality issues.
