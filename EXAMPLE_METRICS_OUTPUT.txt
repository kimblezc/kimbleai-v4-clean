CALCULATION EXAMPLES

1. TIME SAVED
   Task: fix_bugs (completed)
   Manual time estimate: 45 minutes
   Archie completion time: 0.12 minutes
   Time saved: 44.88 minutes per task
   Total for 39 fixes: 1,750 minutes = 29.2 hours

2. COST
   Average tokens per task: 1,500
   Cost per 1K tokens: $0.003
   Cost per task: $0.0045
   Total for 259 tasks: $1.17

3. ROI
   Time saved: 18.5 hours
   Value: 18.5 × $50 = $925
   Cost: $12.50

4. SUCCESS RATE
   Completed: 247
   Failed: 12
   Total: 259
   Success: (247 / 259) × 100 = 95.4%
