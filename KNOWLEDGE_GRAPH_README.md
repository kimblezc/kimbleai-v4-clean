## 🏗️ Architecture

### Database Layer
- **PostgreSQL** with graph extensions for optimal performance
- **Entity table** stores all extracted entities with metadata
- **Relationship table** maps connections with confidence scores
- **Optimized indexes** for fast graph traversal and search

### AI Processing Pipeline
1. **Content Ingestion** - Accepts text, conversations, files, emails
2. **Entity Extraction** - AI + pattern matching for high accuracy
3. **Relationship Discovery** - Multiple algorithms for connection finding
4. **Confidence Scoring** - Quality assessment for all extractions
5. **Graph Storage** - Efficient storage with metadata preservation

### Visualization Engine
- **D3.js** for interactive network visualization
- **Real-time updates** as new data is processed
- **Multiple layout algorithms** for optimal display
- **Zoom, pan, and filter** controls for exploration

## 🛠️ Quick Setup

### 1. Database Setup
```sql
-- Run the provided schema
psql -d your_database -f sql/knowledge-graph-schema.sql
```

### 2. Environment Variables
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install d3 @types/d3
```

### 4. Initialize
```typescript
// Initialize the knowledge graph
await fetch('/api/agents/knowledge-graph', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ action: 'initialize' })
});
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Process Content
```typescript
// Extract entities from any content
const result = await fetch('/api/agents/knowledge-graph', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    action: 'process',
    content: 'John Smith is working on the AI project with Sarah...',
    contentType: 'text',
    sourceId: 'conversation_123'
  })
});

// Result: Entities (John Smith, AI project, Sarah) and relationships
```

### Search the Graph
```typescript
// Find entities and their connections
const results = await fetch('/api/agents/knowledge-graph?action=search&query=AI project&includeConnections=true');

// Returns: Matching entities with their relationship network
```

### Get Recommendations
```typescript
// Discover potential connections
const recommendations = await fetch('/api/agents/knowledge-graph', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    action: 'recommend',
    entityId: 'person_uuid_123'
  })
});

// Returns: Suggested relationships and new connections
```

### Visualize the Graph
```tsx
import KnowledgeGraphViz from '@/components/agents/KnowledgeGraphViz';

<KnowledgeGraphViz
  width={800}
  height={600}
  onNodeClick={(node) => handleNodeClick(node)}
  colorScheme="type"
  showLabels={true}
/>
```
