## 🛠️ How to Set Up Claude + MCP (Step by Step)

### Prerequisites:
- Claude Pro subscription ($20/month) - get at claude.ai
- Node.js installed
- Your Google OAuth credentials (you already have these)

### Step 1: Install Claude Desktop
1. Download from claude.ai/download
2. Install and sign in with Claude Pro account

### Step 2: Install Google Workspace MCP Server

```bash
# Install the MCP server globally
npm install -g @taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp
```

### Step 3: Configure Claude Desktop

**Mac:** Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows:** Edit `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-workspace": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp"],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
        "GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Use your existing credentials from .env.local:**
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - already in your .env.local
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - already in your .env.local

### Step 4: Restart Claude Desktop

### Step 5: Test It

Open Claude Desktop and try:
- "List my recent Gmail messages"
- "Send an email to test@example.com with subject 'Test' and body 'This is a test'"
- "List files in my Google Drive"
- "Create a new Google Doc titled 'Test Document'"
- "Show my calendar events for tomorrow"

If configured correctly, Claude will execute these actions via MCP.

### Troubleshooting:
- Check Claude Desktop logs (Help → View Logs)
- Verify OAuth credentials are correct
- Ensure MCP server installed correctly: `npm list -g @taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp`
