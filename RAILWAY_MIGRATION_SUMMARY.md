# Railway Migration Summary

**Complete Report: Vercel to Railway Migration Preparation**

## Executive Summary

All configuration, scripts, and documentation have been prepared for migrating kimbleai.com from Vercel (serverless) to Railway (persistent server). The migration is necessary to enable MCP stdio transport, which requires spawning child processes - a capability not available in Vercel's serverless environment.

**Status**: ✅ Ready for deployment (manual authentication required)

## Problem Statement

### Current Issue on Vercel

**MCP Connection Failures**:
```
[MCP-CONNECT] Attempting to connect to filesystem server...
[ERROR] Connection timeout after 60000ms
[ERROR] StdioClientTransport: Cannot spawn child process
```

**Root Cause**: Vercel's serverless functions cannot spawn child processes (`npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`), which is required by MCP SDK's stdio transport.

### Solution: Railway

Railway runs a persistent Node.js server that fully supports:
- ✅ Child process spawning
- ✅ Long-running processes
- ✅ Predictable resource allocation
- ✅ MCP stdio transport

## Files Created

### 1. Configuration Files

**railway.toml** (`C:\Users\zachk\OneDrive\Documents\kimbleai-v4-clean\railway.toml`)
- Next.js build configuration
- Health check setup
- Node.js 22.x environment
- Auto-detected by Railway

### 2. Environment Setup Scripts

**setup-railway-env.ps1** (Windows)
- Reads `.env.production`
- Sets all required Railway variables
- Validates configuration

**setup-railway-env.sh** (Linux/Mac)
- Same functionality for Unix systems
- Bash-compatible

### 3. Testing & Verification

**test-railway-deployment.ts**
- Comprehensive test suite
- Tests 7 critical areas:
  1. Health endpoint
  2. Home page load
  3. NextAuth configuration
  4. API accessibility
  5. MCP server endpoints
  6. Environment variables
  7. Database connection

### 4. Documentation

**RAILWAY_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md** (Complete, 30-45 min guide)
- 8 phases of migration
- Step-by-step instructions
- Troubleshooting section
- Rollback plan

**RAILWAY_QUICKSTART.md** (Quick start, 15 min)
- Condensed version
- Essential steps only
- Fast deployment path

**CLAUDE.md** (Updated)
- Replaced Vercel instructions with Railway
- Railway CLI commands
- Deployment process
- Troubleshooting guide

## Migration Workflow

### Phase 1: Railway Account Setup
1. Create Railway account at https://railway.app
2. Install Railway CLI: `npm install -g @railway/cli` ✅ Done
3. Login: `railway login` (requires user interaction)
4. Initialize project: `railway init`

### Phase 2: Environment Configuration
1. Run setup script: `.\scripts\setup-railway-env.ps1`
2. Verify variables: `railway variables`

### Phase 3: Initial Deployment
1. Deploy: `railway up`
2. Monitor: `railway logs --tail`
3. Get URL: `railway domain`

### Phase 4: Testing
1. Run test suite: `npx tsx scripts/test-railway-deployment.ts <url>`
2. Verify MCP stdio connectivity
3. Test all features

### Phase 5: Domain Configuration
1. Add custom domain: `railway domain add kimbleai.com`
2. Update DNS records
3. Update OAuth redirect URIs

### Phase 6: Production Switch
1. Point DNS to Railway
2. Monitor for 24-48 hours
3. Deactivate Vercel (optional)

## Technical Changes

### Deployment Architecture

**Before (Vercel)**:
- Serverless functions
- No persistent processes
- Cannot spawn child processes
- 60s function timeout
- Free tier

**After (Railway)**:
- Persistent Node.js server
- Long-running processes supported
- Child processes work
- Configurable timeouts
- $5/mo starter plan

### Environment Variables

All existing Vercel environment variables will be migrated:
- ✅ Supabase configuration
- ✅ NextAuth secrets
- ✅ Google OAuth credentials
- ✅ API keys (OpenAI, AssemblyAI)
- ✅ Zapier webhooks

### Build Process

**Unchanged**:
- Still uses `npm run build`
- Still uses `npm start`
- Same Next.js 15.5.3
- Same Node.js 22.x

**Changed**:
- Railway uses Nixpacks builder (auto-detects)
- Build time: 3-5 minutes (similar to Vercel)
- No max function size limits

### Database

**No changes required**:
- Supabase remains external
- Same connection strings
- Same RLS policies
- Zero migration needed

## Expected Outcomes

### Success Metrics

1. **MCP Connectivity**: stdio transport connects without errors
2. **Tool Execution**: Can execute MCP tools (filesystem, github, memory)
3. **Performance**: Response times similar or better than Vercel
4. **Stability**: No crashes or memory issues
5. **Features**: All existing features work identically

### Known Limitations

1. **Cron Jobs**: Railway doesn't have built-in cron
   - Solution: Keep Vercel cron endpoints, point to Railway URLs
   - Or use external cron service (cron-job.org)

2. **Cost**: $5/mo vs Vercel's free tier
   - Justification: MCP functionality is critical
   - Free trial includes $5 credit

3. **Edge Network**: Not as extensive as Vercel's
   - Impact: Minimal (database is main bottleneck)

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- ✅ Database unchanged (Supabase external)
- ✅ Code unchanged (same Next.js app)
- ✅ Auth unchanged (same NextAuth setup)
- ✅ APIs unchanged (same endpoints)

### Medium Risk
- ⚠️ Cron jobs need alternative scheduling
- ⚠️ DNS propagation downtime (~5 min)
- ⚠️ OAuth redirect URLs need updating

### Mitigation
- ✅ Keep Vercel active as backup
- ✅ Test Railway for 24-48 hours before full switch
- ✅ Rollback plan documented
- ✅ Comprehensive testing script provided

## Timeline

### Automated (Done)
- ✅ Railway CLI installed
- ✅ Configuration files created
- ✅ Scripts written
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ CLAUDE.md updated
- ✅ Version bumped to v6.1.0
