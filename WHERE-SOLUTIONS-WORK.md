## 📱 Mobile Use Case: CRITICAL DIFFERENCE

### Example: You're traveling, Rebecca texts you

**Text from Rebecca:**
> "Can you send the Q4 budget to the client? They need it by 5pm."

### Using Your KimbleAI Agents:
```
YOU (on iPhone, in Uber):
1. Open Safari → kimbleai.com
2. Type: "Send Q4 budget to client@example.com"
3. Agent:
   ✅ Finds Q4 Budget.pdf in Drive
   ✅ Sends email with attachment
   ✅ "Done - email sent at 3:47pm"
4. Text Rebecca: "Sent!"

Time: 30 seconds
```

### Using Claude Desktop + MCP Extensions:
```
YOU (on iPhone, in Uber):
❌ Can't use Claude Desktop on iPhone
❌ Must wait until you get to your Mac
❌ Client doesn't get budget by 5pm

Time: Failed
```

### Using Claude + MCP Connectors:
```
YOU (on iPhone, in Uber):
1. Open Claude app
2. Type: "Send Q4 budget to client@example.com"
3. Claude (via MCP connector):
   ⚠️ Only if you set up remote MCP server
   ✅ Finds Q4 Budget.pdf in Drive
   ✅ Sends email with attachment
4. Text Rebecca: "Sent!"

Time: 30 seconds
BUT: Requires remote MCP server setup + $20/month
```
