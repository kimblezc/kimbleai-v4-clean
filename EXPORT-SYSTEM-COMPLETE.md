# ✅ Google Drive Export System - Complete

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Status:** PRODUCTION READY

## 🎯 What Was Built

### Organized Export System
Created an intelligent export system that:
- **Exports 3 formats** simultaneously: TXT, JSON, SRT
- **Auto-organizes** into folder structure
- **Project-based** organization
- **One command** to export everything

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
Google Drive/
└── kimbleai-transcriptions/
    └── [project-name]/          ← Your current project
        └── [filename]/          ← Each recording gets its own folder
            ├── [filename]_transcript.txt    ← Formatted with timestamps & speakers
            ├── [filename]_data.json         ← Full metadata, tags, action items
            └── [filename]_subtitles.srt     ← For video editing
```

### Example:
```
kimbleai-transcriptions/
└── general/
    └── My recording 11/
        ├── My recording 11_transcript.txt
        ├── My recording 11_data.json
        └── My recording 11_subtitles.srt
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Upload & Transcribe
- Upload your M4A file (up to 2GB)
- Transcription automatically uses your current project
- Wait for completion (shows speaker labels & timestamps)

### 2. Export to Drive
When transcription completes, you'll see:
```
📤 Export to Google Drive:
Type `/export-all [ID]` to save all formats

Files will be organized in: kimbleai-transcriptions/general/filename/
```

### 3. Run the Command
- Copy the command (e.g., `/export-all 123`)
- Paste and press Enter
- Wait ~5-10 seconds

### 4. Get Your Files
You'll receive:
```
✅ Exported to Google Drive!

📁 Folder: [Open Folder]
📍 Location: kimbleai-transcriptions/general/My recording 11

Files created:
- Transcript (TXT)
- Full Data (JSON)
