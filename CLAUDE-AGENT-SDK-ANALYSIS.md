## 🔍 Deep Dive: Claude Agent SDK

### Architecture:

```typescript
// Basic agent structure with Claude Agent SDK
import { Agent, query } from '@anthropic-ai/agent-sdk';

const agent = new Agent({
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-5',
  tools: [
    // Custom tools
    gmailSendTool,
    driveCre ateTool,
    calendarCreateTool
  ],
  mcpServers: [
    // MCP servers for external integrations
    'google-workspace-mcp'
  ],
  systemPrompt: 'You are a personal assistant that manages Gmail, Drive, and Calendar'
});

// Run agent
const result = await agent.run('Send Rebecca an email about the budget meeting');
```

### How It Works:

```
User Query
    ↓
Claude Agent SDK
    ↓
Claude's Reasoning (decides what actions to take)
    ↓
Executes Tools:
  - Custom tools (your code)
  - MCP servers (Gmail/Drive/Calendar)
    ↓
Verifies results
    ↓
Returns response
```

### Integration with Google Workspace:

**Option 1: Via MCP Servers**
```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
  mcpServers: {
    'google-workspace': {
      command: 'npx',
      args: ['-y', '@taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp'],
      env: {
        GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
        GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
      }
    }
  }
});

// Now Claude can use MCP tools:
await agent.run('Send an email to team@example.com about the Q4 results');
```

**Option 2: Custom Tools (Your APIs)**
```typescript
const gmailSendTool = {
  name: 'send_email',
  description: 'Send an email via Gmail API',
  parameters: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      to: { type: 'string' },
      subject: { type: 'string' },
      body: { type: 'string' }
    },
    required: ['to', 'subject', 'body']
  },
  execute: async (params) => {
    // Use YOUR existing gmail API code
    return await yourGmailAPI.sendEmail(params);
  }
};

const agent = new Agent({
  tools: [gmailSendTool, driveCreateTool, calendarCreateTool]
});
```

## 💡 How You Could Use Claude Agent SDK

### Architecture Option 1: Replace Your Agent System

**Before (Your Current System):**
```typescript
// app/api/chat/route.ts
if (mode === 'agent' && agent === 'drive-intelligence') {
  // Your custom logic to search Drive
  const results = await searchDrive(query);
  return formatResponse(results);
}
```

**After (With Claude Agent SDK):**
```typescript
import { Agent } from '@anthropic-ai/agent-sdk';

const agent = new Agent({
  tools: [driveTool, gmailTool, calendarTool],
  systemPrompt: 'You are Drive Intelligence agent...'
});

// Claude decides how to use the tools
const result = await agent.run(userQuery);
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Claude's reasoning decides best approach
- ✅ More autonomous behavior
- ✅ Natural language understanding

**Cons:**
- ❌ Lose fine-grained control
- ❌ API costs for Claude calls
- ❌ Need to rewrite agent system

---

### Architecture Option 2: Hybrid (Recommended)

**Use Claude Agent SDK for complex decisions, keep your system for execution:**

```typescript
// lib/claude-orchestrator.ts
import { Agent } from '@anthropic-ai/agent-sdk';
import { GoogleWorkspaceOrchestrator } from './google-orchestration';

class HybridOrchestrator {
  private claudeAgent: Agent;
  private googleOrchestrator: GoogleWorkspaceOrchestrator;

  async handleComplexQuery(query: string) {
    // Step 1: Claude analyzes and plans
    const plan = await this.claudeAgent.query(`
      Analyze this request and create an action plan:
      "${query}"

      Available capabilities:
      - Search/read/write Gmail
      - Search/read/write Drive
      - Search/read/write Calendar
      - Cross-service workflows

      Return structured JSON plan.
    `);

    // Step 2: Execute using YOUR existing APIs
    const results = await this.googleOrchestrator.executePlan(plan);

    // Step 3: Claude summarizes results
    const summary = await this.claudeAgent.query(`
      Summarize these results for the user:
      ${JSON.stringify(results)}
    `);

    return summary;
  }
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Claude handles complex reasoning
- ✅ You keep control of execution
- ✅ Can monitor costs precisely
- ✅ Best of both worlds

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ More complex architecture
- ⚠️ Need to manage both systems

---

### Architecture Option 3: Agent SDK for New Features Only

**Keep your current system, use Claude Agent SDK for NEW capabilities:**

```typescript
// For existing features: Use your current agents
if (agent === 'drive-intelligence') {
  return await yourDriveAgent.search(query);
}

// For complex automation: Use Claude Agent SDK
if (mode === 'autonomous-workflow') {
  const claudeAgent = new Agent({
    tools: [yourCustomTools],
    mcpServers: ['google-workspace-mcp']
  });

  return await claudeAgent.run(`
    Autonomously handle this workflow:
    1. Search my emails for budget discussions
    2. Extract key numbers
    3. Create a summary doc in Drive
    4. Schedule a follow-up meeting

    Query: ${query}
  `);
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Minimal disruption to existing system
- ✅ Add advanced features gradually
- ✅ Can test before full commitment

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Two systems to maintain
- ⚠️ Inconsistent UX between old/new features

## 🎯 Specific Use Cases for Your Project

### Use Case 1: Email Auto-Filing with Learning

**Without Claude Agent SDK:**
```typescript
// Your code: Hard-coded rules
if (email.from.includes('team@') && email.subject.includes('budget')) {
  labelEmail(email.id, 'Budget');
}
```

**With Claude Agent SDK:**
```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
  tools: [gmailReadTool, gmailLabelTool],
  systemPrompt: `
    You learn from user's email filing patterns.
    Analyze each email and suggest appropriate labels.
  `
});

// Claude learns patterns and makes intelligent decisions
await agent.run(`File this email appropriately based on past patterns: ${email}`);
```

---

### Use Case 2: Calendar Optimization

**Without Claude Agent SDK:**
```typescript
// Your code: Manual conflict detection
const conflicts = findConflicts(events);
if (conflicts.length > 0) {
  suggestAlternatives(conflicts);
}
```

**With Claude Agent SDK:**
```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
  tools: [calendarReadTool, calendarUpdateTool],
  systemPrompt: `
    You optimize calendar scheduling.
    Consider travel time, focus blocks, and user preferences.
  `
});

// Claude reasons about best schedule
await agent.run(`
  Optimize my calendar for next week.
  Preferences: Morning focus time, no back-to-back meetings, lunch at 12pm
`);
```

---

### Use Case 3: Cross-Service Workflows

**Without Claude Agent SDK:**
```typescript
// Your code: Pre-defined workflow
async function meetingWorkflow(meeting) {
  // 1. Create calendar event
  const event = await calendar.create(meeting);

  // 2. Send email to attendees
  await gmail.send({ to: meeting.attendees, subject: '...' });

  // 3. Create notes doc in Drive
  await drive.create({ title: `${meeting.title} Notes` });
}
```

**With Claude Agent SDK:**
```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
  tools: [calendarTools, gmailTools, driveTools],
  systemPrompt: 'You orchestrate multi-service workflows intelligently'
});

// Claude figures out the optimal workflow
await agent.run(`
  Schedule a budget meeting with Rebecca next Tuesday.
  Make sure to:
  - Find a time that works for both
  - Send a proper invite
  - Create an agenda doc
  - Attach last quarter's numbers from Drive
`);

// Claude autonomously:
// 1. Checks both calendars
// 2. Finds best time
// 3. Creates event
// 4. Searches Drive for Q3 numbers
// 5. Creates agenda doc with those numbers
// 6. Sends email with everything attached
```

## 💬 My Honest Opinion

**You DON'T need Claude Agent SDK to accomplish your core goals.**

Your existing system with Google APIs can do everything Claude Agent SDK does - you just need to finish exposing the write operations.

**BUT Claude Agent SDK could make your agents SMARTER:**
- Better natural language understanding
- Autonomous multi-step reasoning
- Context-aware decision making
- Adaptive behavior

**It's NOT essential, but it COULD add value for complex workflows.**

**My recommendation: Finish your write agents first (1-2 weeks), THEN experiment with Claude Agent SDK (1 week prototype). See which approach works better for your needs.**

---

**Want me to:**
1. Build the write agents in your current system? (send email, create file, create event)
2. Create a prototype with Claude Agent SDK to test it?
3. Both?
