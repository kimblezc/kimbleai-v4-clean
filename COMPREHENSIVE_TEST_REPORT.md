# Comprehensive Testing & Debugging Report
**kimbleai.com v1.6.0 (commit 43bafba)**

**Date:** October 25, 2025
**Agent:** Claude Code Testing & Debugging Agent
**Status:** CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED - MIGRATION REQUIRED

---

## Executive Summary

I have identified the root cause of the project creation 500 error and prepared a complete solution. The production database has a **simplified schema** that lacks the columns required by the application code. A database migration is required to fix this issue.

### Current Status
- ❌ **Project Creation**: BROKEN (500 error)
- ⚠️ **Root Cause**: Database schema mismatch
- ✅ **Solution**: SQL migration prepared and ready to apply
- ⏳ **Action Required**: User must run migration in Supabase SQL Editor

---

## 1. Bug Fixes Section

### Bug #1: Project Creation Returns 500 Error

**Description:**
When attempting to create a new project via the frontend, the API returns:
```
POST https://www.kimbleai.com/api/projects 500 (Internal Server Error)
Error: Failed to process project request
```

**Root Cause:**
The production database has a **simplified schema** that is missing critical columns:

| Table | Expected Columns | Actual Columns | Missing |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| `projects` | id, name, description, status, priority, owner_id, collaborators, tags, metadata, stats, parent_project_id | id, name, description, color, user_id, created_at, updated_at | status, priority, owner_id, collaborators, tags, metadata, stats |
| `users` | id, name, email, role, permissions, metadata | id, name, email | role, permissions, metadata |

**Technical Details:**

1. **Permission Check Fails** (line 143 in `app/api/projects/route.ts`):
   ```typescript
   if (!await userManager.hasPermission(userId, 'can_create_projects')) {
   ```
   - This tries to read `users.permissions->can_create_projects`
   - Column `permissions` doesn't exist → **Database error**

2. **Insert Fails** (line 278 in `lib/project-manager.ts`):
   ```typescript
   const { data, error } = await supabase
     .from('projects')
     .insert(project)  // Contains collaborators, tags, status, priority, etc.
   ```
   - Error: `Could not find the 'collaborators' column of 'projects' in the schema cache`
   - These columns don't exist in production

**Fix Applied:**
Created SQL migration files to upgrade the database schema:

1. **Quick Fix** (`database/QUICK_FIX_PROJECTS.sql`):
   - Adds essential columns to `projects`: status, priority, owner_id, collaborators, tags, metadata, stats
   - Adds essential columns to `users`: role, permissions, metadata
   - Updates user 'zach' to admin with full permissions
   - Creates `project_tasks` and `project_collaborators` tables

2. **Full Upgrade** (`database/UPGRADE_PROJECTS_SCHEMA.sql`):
   - Complete schema upgrade with all features
   - Indexes for performance
   - Constraints and foreign keys
   - Trigger functions

**Files Modified:**
- Created: `database/QUICK_FIX_PROJECTS.sql` (73 lines)
- Created: `database/UPGRADE_PROJECTS_SCHEMA.sql` (250 lines)
- Created: `MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (full user guide)
- Updated: `version.json` (line 3: commit hash 63cde8b → 43bafba)

**Verification:**
Migration has NOT been applied yet (requires Supabase SQL Editor access).

After migration is applied, verify with:
```sql
-- Should show all new columns
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'projects';

-- Should show role='admin' and permissions
SELECT id, name, role, permissions FROM users WHERE id = 'zach';
```

## 6. Verification Commands

### Database Verification

```sql
-- 1. Check all projects columns
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'projects'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- 2. Check all users columns
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'users'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- 3. Verify user permissions
SELECT id, name, role,
       permissions->'can_create_projects' as can_create,
       permissions->'can_delete_projects' as can_delete
FROM users WHERE id = 'zach';

-- 4. Check existing projects
SELECT id, name, status, priority, tags,
       array_length(collaborators, 1) as collaborator_count
FROM projects
ORDER BY updated_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 5. Verify new tables exist
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND table_name IN ('project_tasks', 'project_collaborators');
```

### API Testing (Command Line)

```bash
# Test project list (should work)
curl -X GET "https://www.kimbleai.com/api/projects?userId=zach&action=list"

# Test project creation (should work after migration)
curl -X POST "https://www.kimbleai.com/api/projects" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "create",
    "userId": "zach",
    "projectData": {
      "name": "API Test Project",
      "description": "Created via curl",
      "priority": "medium",
      "tags": ["test", "api"]
    }
  }'
```

### Expected Responses

**Before Migration:**
```json
{
  "error": "Failed to process project request",
  "details": "Could not find the 'collaborators' column of 'projects' in the schema cache"
}
```

**After Migration:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "project": {
    "id": "proj_api-test-project_1729900000000",
    "name": "API Test Project",
    "status": "active",
    "priority": "medium",
    "tags": ["test", "api"]
  },
  "message": "Project created successfully"
}
```

---

## 7. Rollback Plan

If the migration causes issues:

### Option 1: Keep New Columns (Recommended)
The migration is **additive only** - it doesn't drop or modify existing columns. You can safely keep the new columns even if unused.

### Option 2: Drop New Columns
```sql
-- ONLY run this if you need to rollback
ALTER TABLE projects
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS status,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS priority,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS owner_id,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS collaborators,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS tags,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS metadata,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS stats,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS parent_project_id;

ALTER TABLE users
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS role,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS permissions,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS metadata;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS project_tasks;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS project_collaborators;
```

### Option 3: Supabase Point-in-Time Recovery
Supabase Pro plan includes automatic backups. You can restore to a point before the migration.

---

## 8. Success Criteria

Migration is successful when:

✅ **All of these tests pass:**

1. Create project via UI → Returns 201 (not 500)
2. List projects → Shows created project
3. Edit project → Changes persist
4. Archive project → Status changes to "archived"
5. Delete project → Project removed from database
6. Add tags to project → Tags save and display
7. Filter by tags → Correct projects returned
8. User has role="admin" in database
9. User has can_create_projects=true in permissions
10. Automated test suite shows 90%+ pass rate

✅ **Production is stable:**

- No 500 errors in production logs
- All existing conversations still work
- All existing data preserved
- Performance is acceptable (< 2s page load)

---

## 9. Post-Migration Monitoring

### Week 1: Monitor These Metrics

1. **Error Rate**
   - Check Vercel logs for 500 errors
   - Target: 0 project-related errors

2. **Performance**
   - Project list load time
   - Project creation time
   - Target: < 2 seconds

3. **Database Size**
   - Monitor table growth
   - Check index usage
   - Verify query performance

4. **User Feedback**
   - Test project creation daily
   - Verify no regressions
   - Check for edge cases

### Logging Queries

```sql
-- Check for errors in application
SELECT * FROM api_logs
WHERE endpoint LIKE '%/api/projects%'
  AND status_code >= 400
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 50;

-- Monitor project creation rate
SELECT DATE(created_at) as date, COUNT(*) as projects_created
FROM projects
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Check most used tags
SELECT tag, COUNT(*) as usage_count
FROM projects, unnest(tags) as tag
GROUP BY tag
ORDER BY usage_count DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## 11. Summary

### What We Found

The production 500 error when creating projects is caused by a **database schema mismatch**. The production database has a simplified schema missing critical columns that the application code expects.

### What We Created

1. ✅ **2 SQL migration files** (quick fix + full upgrade)
2. ✅ **Comprehensive testing suite** (260 lines, 35+ tests)
3. ✅ **Database diagnostics tools** (3 scripts)
4. ✅ **Complete documentation** (this report + migration guide)
5. ✅ **Version update** (commit hash correction)

### What You Need To Do

**CRITICAL - Do This First:**
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run `database/QUICK_FIX_PROJECTS.sql`
3. Test project creation on website
4. Run automated test suite

**Then:**
5. Complete manual testing checklist
6. Deploy version.json update
7. Commit migration files to git
8. Monitor for 1 week

### Expected Outcome

After running the migration:
- ✅ Project creation works (no 500 error)
- ✅ User permissions enforced
- ✅ Project tags functional
- ✅ All CRUD operations work
- ✅ 90%+ test pass rate

**Total Time Required:** ~25 minutes (5 min migration + 20 min testing)
