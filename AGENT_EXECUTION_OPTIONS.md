# Autonomous Agent - Execution Frequency Options

**Current Status:** Runs every hour (too slow for critical fixes)
**Recommendation:** Every 5-15 minutes for production use

---

## üïê Current Schedule

**Cron:** `0 * * * *` (every hour on the hour)

**Execution Pattern:**
```
12:00 PM - Runs for ~5 minutes
12:05 PM - Stops
... 55 minutes of nothing ...
1:00 PM - Runs for ~5 minutes
```

**Problem:**
- Critical bugs wait up to 60 minutes before detection
- Slow response to production issues
- Users experience problems for too long

---

## ‚ö° Recommended Options

### Option 1: Every 5 Minutes (RECOMMENDED for Production)
**Cron:** `*/5 * * * *`

**Execution Pattern:**
```
12:00 PM - Run
12:05 PM - Run
12:10 PM - Run
12:15 PM - Run
... every 5 minutes ...
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Near real-time issue detection (< 5 min delay)
- ‚úÖ Fast response to critical bugs
- ‚úÖ Continuous monitoring without serverless timeout issues
- ‚úÖ Good balance of responsiveness vs. cost

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More Vercel function invocations (still within free tier for small apps)

**Best For:**
- Production apps with users
- Apps requiring high uptime
- Critical systems

**Cost Impact:**
- ~8,640 executions/month (vs. 720 for hourly)
- Still within Vercel free tier limits (100k invocations/month)

---

### Option 2: Every 15 Minutes (Good Balance)
**Cron:** `*/15 * * * *`

**Execution Pattern:**
```
12:00 PM - Run
12:15 PM - Run
12:30 PM - Run
12:45 PM - Run
1:00 PM - Run
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Reasonable response time (< 15 min delay)
- ‚úÖ Lower cost than 5-minute option
- ‚úÖ Good for most production apps

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical bugs could wait up to 15 minutes

**Best For:**
- Medium-traffic apps
- Non-critical production systems
- Budget-conscious deployments

**Cost Impact:**
- ~2,880 executions/month
- Minimal cost even on paid plans

---

### Option 3: Every 10 Minutes (Sweet Spot)
**Cron:** `*/10 * * * *`

**Execution Pattern:**
```
12:00 PM - Run
12:10 PM - Run
12:20 PM - Run
12:30 PM - Run
12:40 PM - Run
12:50 PM - Run
1:00 PM - Run
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Good response time (< 10 min delay)
- ‚úÖ Balanced cost/performance
- ‚úÖ 6x faster than current hourly schedule

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical bugs could wait up to 10 minutes

**Best For:**
- Most production applications
- Good default for active development

**Cost Impact:**
- ~4,320 executions/month
- Still very cheap on any plan

---

### Option 4: Hybrid Schedule (Smart)
**Multiple cron jobs with different frequencies:**

**Critical Monitoring (every 5 min):**
```json
{
  "path": "/api/agent/cron/critical",
  "schedule": "*/5 * * * *"
}
```
- Only monitors for critical errors
- Fast execution (< 1 minute)

**Full Agent Run (every hour):**
```json
{
  "path": "/api/agent/cron",
  "schedule": "0 * * * *"
}
```
- Full analysis, optimization, code quality
- Longer execution (up to 5 minutes)

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Critical issues detected quickly
- ‚úÖ Full analysis runs less frequently
- ‚úÖ Optimized cost/performance

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex setup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need two separate endpoints

---

### Option 5: Continuous (Advanced - Not Recommended)
**Always running via background worker**

**Implementation:**
- Use Vercel Background Functions (if available)
- Or use external service (Railway, Render)
- Runs 24/7 without stopping

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Instant issue detection
- ‚úÖ Real-time monitoring

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Expensive (serverless functions aren't meant for this)
- ‚ùå Complex implementation
- ‚ùå Overkill for most apps

**Best For:**
- Enterprise apps with dedicated infrastructure
- Apps with millions of users
- 99.99% uptime requirements

## üí° My Recommendation

### For Your App (KimbleAI - Production with Active Users):

**Use Option 1: Every 5 Minutes**

**Why:**
- You mentioned transcription failures, 504 errors, slow chatbot
- These are user-facing critical issues
- 5-minute detection means issues get fixed before users get frustrated
- Agent can deploy fixes quickly (within 10-15 minutes of issue occurring)
- Cost is still $0 (well within Vercel free tier)

**Changed Schedule:**
```json
{
  "path": "/api/agent/cron",
  "schedule": "*/5 * * * *"
}
```

**Result:**
- Issue occurs at 2:03 PM
- Agent detects it at 2:05 PM (next run)
- Agent generates fix by 2:07 PM
- Agent deploys fix by 2:10 PM
- **Total time to fix: ~7 minutes** (vs. up to 60 minutes with hourly)

---

## üöÄ Implementation

### To Change Schedule:

**Edit `vercel.json`:**
```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/agent/cron",
      "schedule": "*/5 * * * *"  // Changed from "0 * * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Then deploy:**
```bash
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "feat: Increase agent execution frequency to every 5 minutes"
git push
```

Vercel automatically updates the cron schedule on next deployment.

## üìà Expected Behavior After Change

### Before (Hourly):
```
[12:00] Agent runs ‚Üí finds 0 issues
[12:30] Bug introduced by user action
[12:45] Users experiencing errors (15 min so far)
[1:00]  Agent runs ‚Üí detects issue ‚Üí fixes ‚Üí deploys
[1:10]  Issue resolved
Total user impact: 40 minutes
```

### After (Every 5 Minutes):
```
[12:00] Agent runs ‚Üí finds 0 issues
[12:05] Agent runs ‚Üí finds 0 issues
[12:10] Agent runs ‚Üí finds 0 issues
[12:15] Agent runs ‚Üí finds 0 issues
[12:20] Agent runs ‚Üí finds 0 issues
[12:25] Agent runs ‚Üí finds 0 issues
[12:30] Bug introduced
[12:35] Agent runs ‚Üí detects issue ‚Üí fixes ‚Üí deploys
[12:45] Issue resolved
Total user impact: 15 minutes
```

**Improvement: 62% faster resolution**

## üéØ Action Items

**Immediate (Do Now):**
1. Change schedule from hourly to every 5 minutes
2. Deploy updated vercel.json
3. Verify cron runs every 5 minutes

**Monitor (First Week):**
1. Check agent_logs for execution frequency
2. Verify no performance issues
3. Track Vercel function usage
4. Measure time-to-resolution for issues

**Optimize (After 1 Week):**
1. If 5 minutes is too frequent ‚Üí Change to 10 minutes
2. If critical issues need faster response ‚Üí Consider hybrid approach
3. Review cost (should still be $0)

3. **I'll deploy it:** Update vercel.json, commit, push, verify

**Expected Timeline:**
- Decision: Now
- Implementation: 2 minutes
- Deployment: 3 minutes
- First faster run: Within 5 minutes of deployment
