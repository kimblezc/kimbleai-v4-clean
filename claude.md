### Recent Changes:
- **6647c44** (v7.7.4) - 🦉 COMPREHENSIVE LOGGING DASHBOARD: Completely revamped /agent dashboard with parsed commit analysis, color-coded fix type breakdown (🔧 lint, 🧹 dead code, 🐛 type error, 📦 dependency), individual fix cards, statistics (total fixes, commits, last run), layman explanations section, technical details, and created ARCHIE-LOGGING.md guide. Dashboard now production-ready for monitoring all Archie activity in readable format.
- **9f455c9** (v7.7.3) - 🦉 UX IMPROVEMENT: Added Archie Dashboard button to sidebar for easy access. Green owl button with gradient background and hover effects positioned above version info. Users can now click directly to /agent to monitor Archie's activity without typing the URL.
- **ad93693** (v7.7.2) - 🦉 ARCHIE AI ENHANCEMENT: Enhanced Archie with AI-powered iterative fixing! Now uses GPT-4o to fix complex TypeScript errors with retry logic (up to 3 attempts), tests each fix with tsc/lint, rolls back on failure, and uses progressively aggressive strategies (minimal changes → type assertions → any types). Added comprehensive logging for each fix attempt. Manual trigger tested and working at /api/archie/run?trigger=manual.
- **a4db07f** (v7.7.1) - 🦉 ARCHIE SIMPLIFICATION: Removed complex Archie 2.0 (database, approval queues, SSE streams) and replaced with simple git-based version at lib/archie-agent.ts. Auto-fixes lint/dead code/patches, commits to git, runs hourly via cron. Dashboard at /agent shows git commits by Archie. Archived old API routes. Changed D&D fact rotation from 8 to 30 seconds for better readability.
- **83d8ae3** (v7.7.0) - 🦉 ARCHIE 2.0 INITIAL (later simplified): First attempt at complex approval system - was over-engineered, replaced in v7.7.1 with simpler approach
- **79d7ac3** (v7.6.4) - CRITICAL FIX: React Error #310 resolved with shuffled queue approach - Moved shuffleArray outside component, use ref-based queue of shuffled indices, empty dependency array prevents recreation, maintains full random non-repeating feature
- **00ba6e9** (v7.6.3) - FEATURE: Fantasy-themed fonts - Replaced Inter/Space Grotesk with Cinzel (elegant Roman serif for headers) and Crimson Text (readable serif for body), improved typography with 16px base size, 1.6 line-height, and letter-spacing for D&D rulebook aesthetic
- **8a2f887** (v7.6.2) - HOTFIX: Empty dependency array fix - Changed useEffect from [currentFactIndex] to [] to prevent re-creation on every fact change, uses functional setState for prevIndex access
- **1d43080** (v7.6.2) - HOTFIX: React Error #310 crash - Fixed infinite render loop caused by nested state updates in D&D facts rotation, imported missing useRef hook, refactored to use useRef for tracking used indices (single state update per interval)
- **1b5b670** (v7.6.1) - FEATURE: 20 D&D facts with smart rotation - Expanded to 20 curated facts mixing surface-level and deep lore (THAC0, Vecna, Lady of Pain, Spelljammer, Blood War), smart rotation tracks used facts and never repeats until all shown, provides 2min 40sec of unique content before any repeats
- **39ca25b** (v7.6.0) - FEATURE: Rotating D&D facts on empty state - Removed large "KimbleAI" branding from center, added 10 rotating D&D facts that change every 8 seconds, kept time-based greetings, cleaner minimal UI, changed input placeholder to "Ask me anything..."
- **7ce3fa4** (v7.5.7) - HOTFIX: Fixed TypeError in conversation sorting - Added defensive null checks for conversations without timestamps, prevents 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading getTime)' error
- **38e311d** (v7.5.6) - UX: Added timestamps to conversation sidebar + sorted conversations newest to oldest - Shows relative time (e.g., '2h ago') for each chat, conversations now properly sorted within each group
- **60b37e5** (v7.5.5) - HOTFIX: Fixed 500 error on page load - Improved error handling with detailed logging, added minimal field fallback query, JavaScript-based sorting backup, resilient timestamp handling using message timestamps when conversation timestamps missing
- **5322b57** (v7.5.4) - FINAL FIX: Removed ALL hardcoded user lookups + fixed userId dependency + chronological sorting - Fixed useMessages dependency array, replaced all hardcoded user queries with getUserByIdentifier in conversations & chat APIs, added full timestamps with newest-first sorting, created cleanup script for orphaned conversations
- **af78dbf** (v7.5.3) - FIX: Added robust error handling and filtered test conversations - Graceful 404 handling, removed test data from sidebar
- **d459cd0** (v7.5.2) - FIX: Added GET method to conversations API - Eliminates 405 errors, enables proper conversation loading with messages
- **1f0b147** (v7.5.1) - CRITICAL HOTFIX: Fixed circular dependency causing "Cannot access 'c' before initialization" - Moved useEffect after function definitions
- **ee47d21** (v7.5.0) - FEATURE: Auto-load conversation messages when clicking sidebar chats - Added useEffect to automatically fetch and display old conversations
- **72da669** (v7.4.7) - CRITICAL FIX: Use user.id UUID instead of userId string in projects API - Fixed 500 errors by using actual UUID from user object for owner_id, created_by, assigned_to fields
- **5dd16a4** (v7.4.6) - COMPREHENSIVE FIX: Complete UUID handling across all API endpoints - Added getUserByIdentifier() helper, fixed delete/edit authorization on projects/tags, eliminated all UUID errors
- **78ee567** (v7.4.5) - COMPREHENSIVE FIX: Added flexible user ID mapper (mapUserIdentifier) to handle UUIDs, friendly IDs, and names - eliminates recurring UUID mismatch errors across entire codebase

## Archie - Autonomous Code Maintenance

**A.R.C.H.I.E.** = Autonomous Repository Coding & Housekeeping Intelligence Engine

**Status**: ✅ Active (Runs every hour)

### Philosophy
> "Don't make me think about lint errors. Just fix them."

Archie is a simple, practical coding janitor that automatically maintains kimbleai.com.

**No approval workflows. No databases. No complexity. Just gets stuff done.**

### What Archie Does

Every hour, Archie:
1. **Scans** the codebase for issues (lint, dead code, type errors, dependencies)
2. **Fixes** issues using multiple strategies (up to 3 attempts per issue)
3. **Tests** each fix to verify it actually works (runs tsc/lint)
4. **Rolls back** failed fixes and tries different approaches
5. **Commits** successful fixes to git with detailed messages
6. **Logs** everything with comprehensive attempt tracking

**Auto-Fixes:**
- ✓ Linting errors (`npm run lint --fix`)
- ✓ Unused imports and dead code (AI-powered with GPT-4o-mini)
- ✓ TypeScript errors (AI-powered with GPT-4o, 3 retry attempts)
- ✓ Patch-level dependency updates (1.2.3 → 1.2.4)

**Fix Strategy (Progressive):**
1. **Attempt 1**: Minimal changes, preserve code structure
2. **Attempt 2**: Type assertions, null checks, more aggressive
3. **Attempt 3**: Any types, disable strict checks (last resort)

**Doesn't Touch:**
- ❌ Major refactoring
- ❌ API breaking changes
- ❌ Database schema changes
- ❌ Anything requiring human judgment

### Implementation

**Files:**
- `lib/archie-agent.ts` - Main agent logic
- `app/api/archie/run/route.ts` - API endpoint
- `app/agent/page.tsx` - Dashboard showing activity

**Schedule**: Every hour via Vercel Cron (`0 * * * *`)
**Manual trigger**: `/api/archie/run?trigger=manual`
**Dashboard**: https://www.kimbleai.com/agent

### Safety Features

1. **Max 5 fixes per run** - Prevents going crazy
2. **Max 3 retry attempts** - Stops after 3 failed fix attempts per issue
3. **Test before commit** - Runs tsc/lint to verify each fix works
4. **Automatic rollback** - Reverts failed fixes via git checkout
5. **Git commits** - Every change is tracked and revertable
6. **Dry-run mode** - Test without making changes
7. **Limited scope** - Only touches obvious issues
8. **No databases** - Simple, can't corrupt data
9. **OpenAI optional** - Works without AI (skips complex fixes)

### Monitoring & Access

**Dashboard**: https://www.kimbleai.com/agent
- View all Archie commits with timestamps
- See what was fixed and when
- Manual trigger button available

**Sidebar Button**: Click the green 🦉 button above version info

**Manual Trigger**: `/api/archie/run?trigger=manual` (takes 1-2 min)

**Git Logs**:
```bash
# See all Archie activity
git log --author="Archie" --oneline -20

# See last 24 hours
git log --author="Archie" --since="24 hours ago"
```

### Why This Approach?

**Previous agents (Archie 1.0, MCP, etc.) failed because:**
- Too complex (approval queues, databases)
- Too ambitious (tried to do everything)
- No visibility (ran without logging)
- No accountability (changes disappeared)

**This Archie succeeds because:**
- Simple (one file, one endpoint, one dashboard)
- Focused (only fixes boring stuff)
- Transparent (git commits show everything)
- Practical (actually useful, not theoretical)

### Documentation

See `ARCHIE.md` for full details.

## Task Completion Documentation

**Rule: Always Include Version and Commit Information**

When completing any task (either in Claude Code or at kimbleai.com), ALWAYS include:

### Required Information:
1. **Current Version** - The version number from `version.json` or `package.json`
2. **Commit Hash** - The git commit hash (short form: first 7 characters)
3. **What Changed** - Brief description of the changes made
4. **Status** - Whether it's committed, deployed, or pending

### Format Example:
```
✅ Task completed
Version: v6.0.1
Commit: f0370be
Changes: Fixed project deletion endpoint to actually delete records
Status: Deployed to https://kimbleai.com
```

### When to Include:
- At the end of any feature implementation
- When fixing bugs
- After deploying to production
- When creating or updating documentation
- During code reviews or testing

### Rationale:
This practice ensures:
- **Traceability**: Every change can be traced to a specific commit
- **Version Control**: Clear understanding of what version includes which features
- **Debugging**: Easy to identify when a feature was added or bug was fixed
- **Documentation**: Automatic creation of change log
- **Accountability**: Clear record of all modifications

### Version Numbering:
Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes or complete phase completions
- **MINOR**: New features, non-breaking changes
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, small improvements

---

## Auto-Deployment Process

**Rule: Always Deploy After Completing Features**

After implementing any feature, bug fix, or change to the codebase, follow this process:

### Deployment Platform: Railway

**Important**: We migrated from Vercel to Railway to support MCP stdio transport (child processes).

### 1. Pre-Deployment Checks
```bash
# Verify build succeeds
npm run build

# Check git status
git status

# Run tests if available
npm test
```

### 2. Commit Changes
```bash
# Stage all changes
git add -A

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: Description of what changed"

# Push to repository
git push origin master
```

### 3. Deploy to Railway
```bash
# Deploy current directory to Railway
railway up

# Or trigger deployment from git
railway up --detach
```

### 4. Monitor Deployment
```bash
# Watch logs in real-time
railway logs --tail

# Or view in Railway dashboard
railway open
```

### 5. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Get Railway URL
railway domain

# Run comprehensive test suite
npx tsx scripts/test-railway-deployment.ts <railway-url>
```

Or manually:
1. Visit Railway URL in browser
2. Test health endpoint: `https://your-url.railway.app/api/health`
3. Verify all features work
4. Check for console errors

### Deployment Timeline
- **railway up → Build starts**: Instant
- **Build process**: 3-5 minutes
- **Deployment → Live**: 10-30 seconds
- **Total**: 4-6 minutes

### Railway Configuration

**Configuration File**: `railway.toml`
- **Builder**: NIXPACKS (auto-detects Next.js)
- **Node Version**: 22.x
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `npm start`
- **Health Check**: `/api/health`

**Environment Variables**: Set via CLI or dashboard
```bash
# Set individual variable
railway variables set KEY=value

# Or use automated script
.\scripts\setup-railway-env.ps1  # Windows
./scripts/setup-railway-env.sh   # Linux/Mac
```

### Required Environment Variables
All environment variables from `.env.production`:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET
- NEXTAUTH_URL
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY
- ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL
- ZAPIER_MEMORY_WEBHOOK_URL
- ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_SECRET
- NODE_ENV

### Troubleshooting Deployments

**"Build failed"**:
- Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
- Run `npm run build` locally to reproduce
- Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Check Node version matches (22.x)

**"Changes aren't showing"**:
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check Railway deployment status: `railway status`
- Verify build completed successfully

**"Environment variables missing"**:
- Verify with: `railway variables`
- Re-run setup script if needed
- Check Railway dashboard

**"MCP servers won't connect"**:
- This was the Vercel issue - should work on Railway
- Check logs for process spawn errors
- Verify `npx` is available: `railway run which npx`
- Test manual connection: `railway run npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`

### Deployment Verification Script

Use `scripts/test-railway-deployment.ts` for comprehensive verification:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-railway-deployment.ts https://your-url.railway.app
```

Tests performed:
1. ✅ Health endpoint
2. ✅ Home page loads
3. ✅ NextAuth configured
4. ✅ API accessibility
5. ✅ MCP endpoints accessible
6. ✅ Environment variables present
7. ✅ Database connection

### Cache Management
- **Server-side**: No caching (Railway serves fresh content)
- **Client-side**: Browser cache (hard refresh to clear)
- **Static assets**: Served from Railway's CDN

To force cache invalidation:
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

### Success Criteria
Deployment is successful when:
1. ✅ Railway build completes without errors
2. ✅ Health endpoint returns 200 OK
3. ✅ Production URL loads correctly
4. ✅ All features accessible
5. ✅ MCP stdio servers can connect
6. ✅ Version number updated (if changed)

### Railway Dashboard
- **URL**: https://railway.app
- **Project**: kimbleai
- **View logs**: `railway logs`
- **Open dashboard**: `railway open`
- **Check status**: `railway status`

### Railway CLI Commands

```bash
# Authentication
railway login              # Login to Railway
railway whoami             # Check authentication

# Project management
railway init               # Initialize new project
railway link               # Link to existing project
railway unlink             # Unlink project

# Deployment
railway up                 # Deploy current directory
railway up --detach        # Deploy in background

# Monitoring
railway logs               # View recent logs
railway logs --tail        # Stream logs in real-time
railway status             # Check deployment status
railway open               # Open Railway dashboard

# Environment variables
railway variables          # List all variables
railway variables set      # Set variable
railway variables delete   # Remove variable

# Domain management
railway domain             # Show current domain
railway domain add         # Add custom domain
```

### Migration from Vercel

**Why we migrated**: Vercel's serverless environment cannot spawn child processes, which MCP stdio transport requires. Railway runs a persistent Node.js server that fully supports this.

**Complete migration guide**: See `RAILWAY_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`

**Key differences**:
- ✅ MCP stdio transport works on Railway
- ✅ Persistent server (not serverless functions)
- ✅ Better support for long-running processes
- ✅ More predictable resource allocation
- 💰 Cost: ~$5/mo (vs Vercel's free tier)

### Cron Jobs on Railway

Railway doesn't have built-in cron scheduling like Vercel. Options:

1. **External cron service**: Use cron-job.org or similar
2. **Node-cron**: Implement in-process scheduling
3. **Railway Cron plugin**: Use Railway's cron service (if available)

Current approach: Keep Vercel cron endpoints active, point them to Railway URLs.

### Rationale
Consistent deployment process ensures:
- **Reliability**: Features deploy predictably
- **Traceability**: Every deployment linked to commit
- **Quality**: Build errors caught before going live
- **Speed**: Automated process takes minutes
- **MCP Support**: Stdio transport works correctly
- **Confidence**: Comprehensive testing verifies success
- openai chatgpt5 models exist.
- at every change to code and new deployment update both the Vx.x.x and the commit. include it in your response here in claude code every time.
- ensure that builds are actively deployed and test them iteratively
