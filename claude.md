## Agent Visibility and Oversight

**Rule: All Active Agents Must Be Visible on the Archie Dashboard**

Archie serves as the central oversight coordinator for all autonomous agents in the system. The Archie Dashboard at `/agent` must display:

### Required Information for Each Active Agent:
1. **Agent Name and Type** (e.g., "Archie Utility Agent", "Drive Intelligence Agent")
2. **Current Status** (Active, Running, Idle, Error)
3. **Execution Schedule** (e.g., "Every 15 minutes", "Every 6 hours")
4. **Last Run Time** (When the agent last executed)
5. **What It's Doing** (Current or recent findings)
6. **Next Tasks** (Upcoming tasks in the queue)
7. **API Endpoint** (For manual triggering/debugging)

### Active Agents (as of Oct 2025):
1. **Autonomous Agent** - Every 5 minutes - `/api/agent/cron`
   - Main orchestrator, code analysis, self-improvement

2. **Archie Utility Agent** - Every 15 minutes - `/api/cron/archie-utility`
   - Actionable conversation detection, cost monitoring, task optimization

3. **Drive Intelligence Agent** - Every 6 hours - `/api/cron/drive-intelligence`
   - File organization, duplicate detection, media discovery

4. **Device Sync Agent** - Every 2 minutes - `/api/cron/device-sync`
   - Cross-device state synchronization, conflict resolution

### Dashboard Requirements:
- Must be server-side rendered (no caching)
- Must auto-update on each page visit
- Must show real-time agent status
- Must display findings and tasks from all agents
- Must provide visual indicators for agent health (active/inactive/error)

### Adding New Agents:
When adding a new autonomous agent to the system:
1. Create the agent implementation in `lib/`
2. Create the API endpoint in `app/api/cron/`
3. Add the cron schedule to `vercel.json`
4. **Update the Archie Dashboard** at `app/agent/page.tsx` to include the new agent
5. Document the agent in this file under "Active Agents"

### Rationale:
Without centralized visibility, agents can:
- Run without oversight
- Generate duplicate or conflicting tasks
- Consume resources unnecessarily
- Fail silently without alerting the team

Archie's dashboard provides a single pane of glass for monitoring all autonomous activity, ensuring transparency and accountability in the AI-driven workflow.

## Task Completion Documentation

**Rule: Always Include Version and Commit Information**

When completing any task (either in Claude Code or at kimbleai.com), ALWAYS include:

### Required Information:
1. **Current Version** - The version number from `version.json` or `package.json`
2. **Commit Hash** - The git commit hash (short form: first 7 characters)
3. **What Changed** - Brief description of the changes made
4. **Status** - Whether it's committed, deployed, or pending

### Format Example:
```
‚úÖ Task completed
Version: v6.0.1
Commit: f0370be
Changes: Fixed project deletion endpoint to actually delete records
Status: Deployed to https://kimbleai.com
```

### When to Include:
- At the end of any feature implementation
- When fixing bugs
- After deploying to production
- When creating or updating documentation
- During code reviews or testing

### Rationale:
This practice ensures:
- **Traceability**: Every change can be traced to a specific commit
- **Version Control**: Clear understanding of what version includes which features
- **Debugging**: Easy to identify when a feature was added or bug was fixed
- **Documentation**: Automatic creation of change log
- **Accountability**: Clear record of all modifications

### Version Numbering:
Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes or complete phase completions
- **MINOR**: New features, non-breaking changes
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, small improvements

---

## Auto-Deployment Process

**Rule: Always Deploy After Completing Features**

After implementing any feature, bug fix, or change to the codebase, follow this process:

### Deployment Platform: Railway

**Important**: We migrated from Vercel to Railway to support MCP stdio transport (child processes).

### 1. Pre-Deployment Checks
```bash
# Verify build succeeds
npm run build

# Check git status
git status

# Run tests if available
npm test
```

### 2. Commit Changes
```bash
# Stage all changes
git add -A

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: Description of what changed"

# Push to repository
git push origin master
```

### 3. Deploy to Railway
```bash
# Deploy current directory to Railway
railway up

# Or trigger deployment from git
railway up --detach
```

### 4. Monitor Deployment
```bash
# Watch logs in real-time
railway logs --tail

# Or view in Railway dashboard
railway open
```

### 5. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Get Railway URL
railway domain

# Run comprehensive test suite
npx tsx scripts/test-railway-deployment.ts <railway-url>
```

Or manually:
1. Visit Railway URL in browser
2. Test health endpoint: `https://your-url.railway.app/api/health`
3. Verify all features work
4. Check for console errors

### Deployment Timeline
- **railway up ‚Üí Build starts**: Instant
- **Build process**: 3-5 minutes
- **Deployment ‚Üí Live**: 10-30 seconds
- **Total**: 4-6 minutes

### Railway Configuration

**Configuration File**: `railway.toml`
- **Builder**: NIXPACKS (auto-detects Next.js)
- **Node Version**: 22.x
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `npm start`
- **Health Check**: `/api/health`

**Environment Variables**: Set via CLI or dashboard
```bash
# Set individual variable
railway variables set KEY=value

# Or use automated script
.\scripts\setup-railway-env.ps1  # Windows
./scripts/setup-railway-env.sh   # Linux/Mac
```

### Required Environment Variables
All environment variables from `.env.production`:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET
- NEXTAUTH_URL
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY
- ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL
- ZAPIER_MEMORY_WEBHOOK_URL
- ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_SECRET
- NODE_ENV

### Troubleshooting Deployments

**"Build failed"**:
- Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
- Run `npm run build` locally to reproduce
- Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Check Node version matches (22.x)

**"Changes aren't showing"**:
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check Railway deployment status: `railway status`
- Verify build completed successfully

**"Environment variables missing"**:
- Verify with: `railway variables`
- Re-run setup script if needed
- Check Railway dashboard

**"MCP servers won't connect"**:
- This was the Vercel issue - should work on Railway
- Check logs for process spawn errors
- Verify `npx` is available: `railway run which npx`
- Test manual connection: `railway run npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`

### Deployment Verification Script

Use `scripts/test-railway-deployment.ts` for comprehensive verification:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-railway-deployment.ts https://your-url.railway.app
```

Tests performed:
1. ‚úÖ Health endpoint
2. ‚úÖ Home page loads
3. ‚úÖ NextAuth configured
4. ‚úÖ API accessibility
5. ‚úÖ MCP endpoints accessible
6. ‚úÖ Environment variables present
7. ‚úÖ Database connection

### Cache Management
- **Server-side**: No caching (Railway serves fresh content)
- **Client-side**: Browser cache (hard refresh to clear)
- **Static assets**: Served from Railway's CDN

To force cache invalidation:
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

### Success Criteria
Deployment is successful when:
1. ‚úÖ Railway build completes without errors
2. ‚úÖ Health endpoint returns 200 OK
3. ‚úÖ Production URL loads correctly
4. ‚úÖ All features accessible
5. ‚úÖ MCP stdio servers can connect
6. ‚úÖ Version number updated (if changed)

### Railway Dashboard
- **URL**: https://railway.app
- **Project**: kimbleai
- **View logs**: `railway logs`
- **Open dashboard**: `railway open`
- **Check status**: `railway status`

### Railway CLI Commands

```bash
# Authentication
railway login              # Login to Railway
railway whoami             # Check authentication

# Project management
railway init               # Initialize new project
railway link               # Link to existing project
railway unlink             # Unlink project

# Deployment
railway up                 # Deploy current directory
railway up --detach        # Deploy in background

# Monitoring
railway logs               # View recent logs
railway logs --tail        # Stream logs in real-time
railway status             # Check deployment status
railway open               # Open Railway dashboard

# Environment variables
railway variables          # List all variables
railway variables set      # Set variable
railway variables delete   # Remove variable

# Domain management
railway domain             # Show current domain
railway domain add         # Add custom domain
```

### Migration from Vercel

**Why we migrated**: Vercel's serverless environment cannot spawn child processes, which MCP stdio transport requires. Railway runs a persistent Node.js server that fully supports this.

**Complete migration guide**: See `RAILWAY_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`

**Key differences**:
- ‚úÖ MCP stdio transport works on Railway
- ‚úÖ Persistent server (not serverless functions)
- ‚úÖ Better support for long-running processes
- ‚úÖ More predictable resource allocation
- üí∞ Cost: ~$5/mo (vs Vercel's free tier)

### Cron Jobs on Railway

Railway doesn't have built-in cron scheduling like Vercel. Options:

1. **External cron service**: Use cron-job.org or similar
2. **Node-cron**: Implement in-process scheduling
3. **Railway Cron plugin**: Use Railway's cron service (if available)

Current approach: Keep Vercel cron endpoints active, point them to Railway URLs.

### Rationale
Consistent deployment process ensures:
- **Reliability**: Features deploy predictably
- **Traceability**: Every deployment linked to commit
- **Quality**: Build errors caught before going live
- **Speed**: Automated process takes minutes
- **MCP Support**: Stdio transport works correctly
- **Confidence**: Comprehensive testing verifies success
- openai chatgpt5 models exist.
- at every change to code and new deployment update both the Vx.x.x and the commit. include it in your response here in claude code every time.
- ensure that builds are actively deployed and test them iteratively
