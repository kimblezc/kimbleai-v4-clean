## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION ARCHITECTURE

### **Deep Research Mode Implementation**

```typescript
// lib/deep-research-agent.ts
class DeepResearchAgent {
  // 1. Break query into research questions
  async generatePlan(query: string) {
    return await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'gpt-4o',
      messages: [{
        role: 'system',
        content: 'Break this into 5-7 searchable questions'
      }]
    });
  }

  // 2. Execute web searches for each question
  async multiStepSearch(questions: string[]) {
    const results = [];
    for (const q of questions) {
      const searchResults = await webSearch(q, 5);
      results.push({ question: q, sources: searchResults });
    }
    return results;
  }

  // 3. Deep analysis with reasoning
  async analyzeWithReasoning(query: string, sources: any[]) {
    return await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'gpt-4o',
      messages: [{
        role: 'system',
        content: 'Analyze deeply, identify patterns, note contradictions'
      }, {
        role: 'user',
        content: `Query: ${query}\nSources: ${JSON.stringify(sources)}`
      }],
      max_tokens: 4000
    });
  }

  // 4. Generate comprehensive report
  async generateReport(query: string, analysis: string) {
    return await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'gpt-4o',
      messages: [{
        role: 'system',
        content: 'Write a professional research report with citations'
      }],
      max_tokens: 8000
    });
  }
}
```

**Key Differences from Current:**
- **Multi-step execution** - Not a single API call
- **Web search integration** - External data sources
- **Progress streaming** - User sees each step
- **Citation tracking** - Sources numbered [1], [2]
- **Longer output** - 2000-4000 words vs 200-500

---

### **Agent Mode Implementation**

```typescript
// app/api/chat/route.ts
async function executeAgentMode(agentId: string, messages: any[], userData: any) {

  const query = messages[messages.length - 1].content;

  switch (agentId) {

    case 'drive-intelligence':
      // SEMANTIC SEARCH on Drive files
      const embedding = await generateEmbedding(query);
      const { data } = await supabase.rpc('match_knowledge_base', {
        query_embedding: embedding,
        match_threshold: 0.4,
        match_count: 10
      });

      // Filter for Drive files only
      const driveFiles = data.filter(item =>
        item.source_type === 'google_drive'
      );

      // Format rich response
      return formatDriveResults(driveFiles);

    case 'audio-intelligence':
      // DIRECT QUERY on audio_transcriptions
      const { data: audio } = await supabase
        .from('audio_transcriptions')
        .select('*')
        .eq('user_id', userData.id)
        .ilike('transcription', `%${query}%`);

      return formatAudioResults(audio);

    case 'knowledge-graph':
      // VECTOR SEARCH on knowledge_base
      const kbEmbedding = await generateEmbedding(query);
      const { data: knowledge } = await supabase.rpc('match_knowledge_base', {
        query_embedding: kbEmbedding,
        match_threshold: 0.4
      });

      // Group by category
      const grouped = groupByCategory(knowledge);
      return formatKnowledgeResults(grouped);

    // ... other agents
  }
}
```

**Key Differences from Current:**
- **No AI generation** - Direct database queries (most agents)
- **Domain filtering** - Only searches relevant tables
- **Structured formatting** - Lists, tables, metadata
- **Fast execution** - No multi-pass reasoning
- **Specialized logic** - Each agent has custom workflow

## 💡 WHY THESE ARE BETTER

### **Deep Research is Better Than Current System For:**

#### **1. External Research**
**Current:** Can't search web, limited to your existing data
**Deep Research:** Searches entire web, finds latest information

**Example:**
```
Query: "What are the latest AI model architectures in 2025?"

Current System:
"I don't have information about 2025 AI architectures in your data."

Deep Research:
"## Latest AI Model Architectures in 2025

### Executive Summary
Based on 32 sources from ArXiv, research papers, and industry blogs...

### Key Findings
1. **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) dominance** [1][2][3]
   - GPT-5 uses MoE with 16 expert networks
   - 10x cost reduction vs dense models

2. **State Space Models (SSM)** [4][5]
   - Mamba architecture gaining adoption
   - Linear complexity vs quadratic for transformers

3. **Multimodal architectures** [6][7][8]
   ...

[32 sources cited]
```

#### **2. Multi-Step Reasoning**
**Current:** Single AI call, one perspective
**Deep Research:** Multiple searches, synthesizes across sources

**Example:**
```
Query: "Should I use PostgreSQL or MongoDB for my AI app?"

Current System:
"PostgreSQL is good for structured data, MongoDB for flexibility..."

Deep Research:
"## PostgreSQL vs MongoDB for AI Applications

### Research Methodology
Analyzed 28 technical blogs, 12 benchmark studies, 8 case studies

### Key Contradictions Found
- Source [1] claims MongoDB 3x faster for embeddings
- Source [12] shows PostgreSQL pgvector outperforms MongoDB
- Resolution: Performance depends on data size and query patterns

### Synthesized Recommendation
For AI applications with vector embeddings:
1. **Under 1M vectors**: MongoDB Atlas Search (sources [1][3][7])
2. **1M-10M vectors**: PostgreSQL pgvector (sources [12][15][18])
3. **Over 10M vectors**: Specialized DB like Pinecone (sources [20][24])

Based on cross-referencing 28 sources, PostgreSQL pgvector is optimal
for your scale if you need ACID guarantees [12][15][18][21]."
```

#### **3. Citation & Verification**
**Current:** No sources, just AI opinion
**Deep Research:** Every claim cited, verifiable

---

### **Agent Mode is Better Than Current System For:**

#### **1. Speed**
**Current:** 2-5 seconds (full RAG retrieval + AI generation)
**Agent:** 0.1-2 seconds (direct database query)

**Example:**
```
Query: "Show my audio recordings from last week"

Current System (3 seconds):
- Gather Drive files
- Gather emails
- Gather calendar
- Gather audio files
- Add all to AI context
- Generate response
Result: "Here are your audio recordings..."

Audio Agent (0.5 seconds):
- Query audio_transcriptions WHERE created_at > last_week
- Format results
Result: [Structured list with metadata]
```

#### **2. Structured Output**
**Current:** Conversational paragraph
**Agent:** Formatted lists, tables, metadata

**Example:**
```
Query: "My API costs this month"

Current System:
"You've spent approximately $45 this month on API calls, primarily
using GPT-4o which accounts for most of the cost. Your usage has
been consistent."

Cost Monitor Agent:
## 💰 Cost Monitor Report

### Last 30 Days Summary
- **Total API Calls:** 1,247
- **Total Cost:** $45.32
- **Average per call:** $0.0363
- **Daily average:** $1.51

### Cost Breakdown by Model
- **gpt-4o**: 234 calls, $32.10 (71%)
- **gpt-4o-mini**: 891 calls, $11.20 (25%)
- **text-embedding-3-small**: 122 calls, $2.02 (4%)

### Recent Activity
- 2025-01-08 14:23: gpt-4o - $0.0423
- 2025-01-08 14:15: gpt-4o-mini - $0.0089
- 2025-01-08 13:58: gpt-4o - $0.0512
...
```

#### **3. Domain Expertise**
**Current:** General-purpose AI, doesn't know table structures
**Agent:** Specialized logic for each domain

**Example:**
```
Query: "Find my files about Rome"

Current System:
- Searches all tables
- Gets confused between emails, files, calendar
- Mixed results

Drive Intelligence Agent:
- Knows to filter source_type = 'google_drive'
- Uses file-specific metadata
- Provides Drive-specific actions (Open in Drive button)
- Understands file types and versions
```

#### **4. Cost Efficiency**
**Current:** Always calls AI ($0.01-0.03 per query)
**Agent:** Many agents use direct queries ($0.00)

**Cost Comparison:**
```
100 queries to "Show my projects":

Current System:
- 100 AI calls × $0.02 = $2.00

Project Context Agent:
- 100 database queries × $0.00 = $0.00
- (No AI needed for listing)
```
